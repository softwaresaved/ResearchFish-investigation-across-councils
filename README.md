ResearchFish data on Software Outputs

At the EPSRC software strategy day on 24 October, Simon met with Louise Tillman
and discussed the "software outputs" available on ResearchFish. Louise offered
to download all software outputs for EPSRC grants and share them with us.

The file "Software&TechnicalProducts - ResearchFish.xlsx" contains around 1600
software outputs sent to us on 17 November 2016 by Louise Tillman.

Louise describes the content as:

"These are self-reported outputs that PIs have submitted. We had a good
submission rate overall (I think the 2016 report that is due to be published
on our website in the next couple of weeks  says that we had 95% of PIs
completed with 100% completion on current grants). However this does not
tell you much about the quality of the data (software is not one of the
mandatory boxes that must be filled in to comply).

 

It is not the start date but the end date of the grants that controls
whether PIs are asked to submit:

·Normally mandatory if current or <5 yrs since grant end date

·Either optional or not possible after that (most EP grants >6 yrs
old ‘closed’, but could be re-opened on request).

So I think the earliest start date of the grants in the data set is 2006.
The newest grants (i.e. those that have only just been funded / a year
or so in) are not asked to submit outcomes immediately as that would not
be realistic."
