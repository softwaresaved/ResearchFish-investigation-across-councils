Phys. 128 014109 (2008) doi:10.1063/1.2805379 The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.",http://www.siremol.org/Sire/Home.htmlEP/E023827/1,Rural e-services: Participatory co-design of sustainable software and business systems in rural co-operatives,Sheffield Hallam University,,2006-09-01,2009-06-30,Andy,Dearden,Kheti,Webtool/Application,,"Kheti is a communication concept combining software on mobile camera phones and web 2.0 services.

Multiple-exposure methods increase the total experimental time in a potentially unacceptable manner and, without abeam-stop, the central disc can exhibit blooming on conventional slow-readout CCDs, resulting in serious loss of data. CMOS Active Pixel Sensors (APSs) provide a high-speed imaging capability with much reduced blooming artefacts when compared to CCDs and have the potential for multiple Region of-Interest (ROI) readout. Such sensors may solve some of the fundamental problems encountered with conventional detectors used for diffractive imaging.

We wrote the acquisition and analysis software and demonstrated the capability to image (mouse) tissue expressing CFY, YFP and GFFP in real-time (~Hz).  This confocal FLIM endomicroscope can be configured with outside diameters of less than 2 mm, providing access to many internal organs in humans and animals.  For animal imaging the is tremendous potential impact for drug discovery, preclinical imaging and basic biomedical research if cell signalling processes could be read out in real time in live disease models using Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) to study protein-protein interactions.  To this end we showed that our instrument can realise FLIM FRET of live cells in expressing GFP and mCherry constructs and we are working with the CRUL London Research Institute to translate this to in vivo experiments.

This new approach permits 3-D imaging via ultrathin (~100?s microns) fibre-optic bundles with no need for distal optics or moving parts since both scanning and focussing can be implemented by manipulating the phase profile of the excitation light emerging from the optical fibre cores at the distal end of the fibre optic bundle.

The accurate prediction of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies is one of the grand challenge problems of computational science. Binding free energy measures the strength of binding between a ligand and a protein, and an algorithm that would allow its accurate prediction would be a powerful tool for rational drug design. Here we present the development of a new method that allows for the absolute binding free energy of a protein-ligand complex to be calculated from first principles, using a single simulation. Our method involves the use of a novel reaction coordinate that swaps a ligand bound to a protein with an equivalent volume of bulk water. This water-swap reaction coordinate is built using an identity constraint, which identifies a cluster of water molecules from bulk water that occupies the same volume as the ligand in the protein active site. A dual topology algorithm is then used to swap the ligand from the active site with the identified water cluster from bulk water. The free energy is then calculated using replica exchange thermodynamic integration. This returns the free energy change of simultaneously transferring the ligand to bulk water, as an equivalent volume of bulk water is transferred back to the protein active site. This, directly, is the absolute binding free energy. It should be noted that while this reaction coordinate models the binding process directly, an accurate force field and sufficient sampling are still required to allow for the binding free energy to be predicted correctly. In this paper we present the details and development of this method, and demonstrate how the potential of mean force along the water-swap coordinate can be improved by calibrating the soft-core Coulomb and Lennard-Jones parameters used for the dual topology calculation.

It can produce point isovists, that is, polygons representing the visually accessible area from a location, along with measures of those polygons (such as perimeter, area and so on), or it can further join a dense grid of isovists into a visibility graph of intervisible points (with graphs of up to about 1000000 point locations). The visibility graph may then be analysed directly using graph measures, or used as the core of an agent-based analysis. In the agent-based analysis a number of software agents representing pedestrians are released into the environment. Each software agent is able to access the visual accessibility information for its current location from the visibility graph, and this informs its choice of next destination. The numbers of agents passing through gates can be counted, and compared to actual numbers of pedestrians passing through gates.At the small to medium urban scale, depthmapX can be used to derive an 'axial map' of a layout. That is, derive a reduced straight-line network of the open space in an environment. The axial map has been the staple of space syntax research for many years, but the mathematical derivation of it is novel. The automatic derivation allows an objective map for research into city form and function. Once the map has been generated, it may be analysed using graph measures, and the measures may be transferred to gate layers in order to compare with indicators of pedestrian or social behaviour. For larger systems where the derivation algorithm becomes cumbersome, pre-drawn axial maps may be imported.Axial maps may be broken into segment maps, or segment maps, such as road-centre line maps, may be imported directly. These may be analysed using a variety of techniques, such as according to angular separation, road distance, or segment steps. For example, number of shortest angular paths through a segment may be calculated, or the average road distance from each segment to all others may be calculated.",2012,"The software covers two separate models for spatial analysis; the Space Syntax model and the Agent model. These two models are theoretically different in spite of the fact that they agree on the principal relationship between space and society. They start from different representations, and they diverge at the point of modelling. The agent model represents an emergent process that leads to form aggregate patterns of movement activity. Through its ability to display movement data in relation to aggregate patterns of agents, depthmapX's agents have proven to be an effective tool to simulate natural movement. Space Syntax builds on a synchronic reduction of spatial relationships in the built environment. Mapping this reduction into networks of longest and fewest lines, depthmapX's axial and segment analyses are powerful methods for predicting to-movement and through-movement in cities. On the scale of buildings, spatial analysis using depthmapX can reveal relational structures that convey how social organisations occupy spaces. depthmapX is a platform that brings together these too models to be tested in an analytical approach. It also affords experimental and developer approaches.The current usage of this software has proven to engage different types of academic communities that have a language in common with the notion of space. These communities range between planners, designers, social scientists, anthropologists, crime scientists, geographers, computer scientists and economists. In general terms, all what brings together the social and the spatial. In different contexts, spatial modelling using depthmapX can help forming assumptions about social behaviour in space and model spatial and social relationships. Moreover, depthmapX significance exceeds its common usage as an analytical tool to understand the built environment on different scales and go beyond that to act as a design and decision making support tool. The intelligent usage of software will deploy it in supporting design process with a knowledge-base that is suggested to make designs more responsive towards the real settings of the built environment. In simple terms, depthmapX is increasingly used as a tool for design thinking. By using it efficiently, the software helps on sparing time and cost, particularly on the scale of complex buildings and large scale urban planning.",http://varoudis.github.io/depthmapX/EP/G02619X/1,"Platform Grant: Space, Technologies and the Design of the Built Environment",University College London (UCL),,2009-09-01,2015-03-31,Alan,Penn,depthmapXnet and Space Syntax Toolkit for QGIS,Software,Yes,"The "Space Syntax Toolkit" is a QGIS plug-in for spatial network and statistical analysis.

The "Graph analysis" module supports the verification and analysis of the spatial network model. This consists of an axial map layer, representing the urban street network, and an unlinks layer, indicating bridges and tunnels with no level crossing. The module offers a verification tool to check the geometric and topological integrity of each layer, helping correct any problems before running the analysis. The axial and segment analysis is performed in depthmapXnet, via a direct link from QGIS, which receives and prepares the results once the calculations are completed. The "Attributes explorer" module supports the visual and statistical exploration of the analysis results. It provides quick analysis of individual quantitative attributes of a selected layer, mapping the values using simplified symbology settings, displaying essential descriptive statistics, and plotting basic interactive charts (histogram and scatter plot).""urrently the "Space Syntax Toolkit" consists of two modules: "Graph analysis" and "Attributes explorer".

Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model (Sarkka et al., 2012; Hartikainen et al. 2012).",http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v15/EP/I011587/1,HUMAN-AGENT COLLECTIVES: FROM FOUNDATIONS TO APPLICATIONS [ORCHID],University of Southampton,,2011-01-01,2016-06-30,Nick,Jennings,Smart Home Network,Webtool/Application,,"The smart home framework (SHF) is a software framework aimed to simplify and speed up the modelling of smart infrastructure (i.e., smart home, smart communities and the smart grid) in the research community.

Developing the science to describe and predict how people move from one place to another during their daily lives promises to address a wide range of societal challenges: from predicting the spread of infectious diseases, improving urban planning, to devising effective emergency response strategies. Individuals are also set to benefit from this area of research, as mobile devices will be able to analyse their mobility pattern and offer context-aware assistance and information. For example, a service could warn about travel disruptions before the user is likely to encounter them, or provide recommendations and mobile vouchers for local services that promise to be of high value to the user, based on their predicted future plans. More ambitiously, control systems for home heating and electric vehicle charging could be enhanced with knowledge of when the user will be home.",2013,"◾ Rahwan, I., Dsouza, S., Rutherford, A., Naroditskiy, V., McInerney, J., &amp; Venanzi, M., et al.

Hundreds of sensors can be carried by a single individual to enable installation in one go. These sensors are intelligent. They sense their environment and orientation and are self-calibrating. Previously, sensors often required an engineer to reconfigure the firmware according to the situation, and the data that they produced needed to be treated and transformed before producing meaningful results. Other sensors needed careful alignment and to be placed in a predetermined orientation before the sensor could report back alignment data. Utterberry's sensors are simple to use and operate. They measure multiple parameters at once, a single sensor typically measuring seven or more parameters.

These components can then be linked to form more advanced processes by applying coordination forms to them. Coordination forms allow the specification of richer orchestration than traditional workflow languages and the library is extensible to allow the addition of further coordination forms. Coordination forms can vary from basic structures, such as specifying that a set of dependent components are processed sequentially or that a set of independent components may be processed in parallel, to advanced domain specific languages. A further key benefit of both components and coordination forms specified within the libhpc-cf library is that both can have multiple implementations allowing different approaches to be used to undertake a given task depending on the type of target computing platform to be used or the problem being addressed.",2015,"The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;.

Of the genome sequences of H7N9 neuraminidase available, one contains a substitution of arginine to lysine at position 292, suggesting a potential for reduced drug binding efficacy. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir bound to H7N9, H7N9-R292K, and a structurally related H11N9 neuraminidase. They show that H7N9 neuraminidase is structurally homologous to H11N9, binding the drugs in identical modes. The simulations reveal that the R292K mutation disrupts drug binding in H7N9 in a comparable manner to that observed experimentally for H11N9-R292K. Absolute binding free energy calculations with the WaterSwap method confirm a reduction in binding affinity. This indicates that the efficacy of antiviral drugs against H7N9-R292K will be reduced. Simulations can assist in predicting disruption of binding caused by mutations in neuraminidase, thereby providing a computational 'assay.'",http://www.siremol.org/Sire/Home.htmlEP/I030395/1,Adaptive Multi-Resolution Massively-Multicore Hybrid Dynamics,University of Bristol,,2011-09-05,2013-09-04,Adrian,Mulholland,Acquire job scheduler,Grid Application,,"Production release of the Acquire job scheduler.

The original LIFE construction was built with calcium silicate board.  This material proved unable to withstand the temperatures of the sizes of fire necessary to achieve under-ventilation.  For this reason the original walls were replaced with fire-grade masonry and the new walls were topped with a steel roof (with insulation).  2.	Data suggested that the airflow into the apparatus was being over-measured.  Detailed investigation showed that the air movement through the inlet channel did not approximate plug flow.  The air inlet channel was redesigned and fitted with new, better performing, instrumentation.  The new instrumentation was characterised using a wind tunnel.3.	It proved difficult to achieve under-ventilated combustion in the early version of the apparatus due to extra air reaching the combustion chamber by leaking in through the outlet channel.  The outlet channel was reconstructed with a ceramic fibre restriction in order to restrict the counterflow of effluent.4.	It was found that the temperature measurements taken in the enclosure did not describe the combustion conditions adequately.  A new thermocouple tree was placed in the interface between the room and corridor.  This extra data allows the interface between the upper and lower layers to be understood more definitely.5.

DNA reuse in combinatorial library construction is one such idea. Here, we describe an algorithm for planning multistage assembly of DNA libraries with shared intermediates that greedily attempts to maximize DNA reuse, and show both theoretically and empirically that it runs in linear time. We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover.

Sentiment analysis is very popular and widely used. It involves the search of key patterns recognised to indicate sentiment within a portion of unstructured text. Hardware acceleration of sentiment analysis is of significant benefit, for increasing the number of key pattern and data size within a given time frame. Analysing a large number of ?tweets? is a key component of Sentiment Analysis. Hardware accelerated tweet analysis has been chosen as the use-case to demonstrate the research output of the ARIS project. In order to generate a meaningful comparison a full implementation in Java. This software-only implementation ran on the host CPU. The second implementation invoked the hardware accelerators to perform the regular expression matching. A substantial dataset of Twitter content (878,773 tweets) was captured and a test set of 11 company names was selected at random. The software-only implementation performed the task in 463 seconds while the accelerated implementation took approximately 79 seconds in total. However it should be noted that this is almost entirely due to the overhead in loading the dataset from the host file system into memory (78.94s). The actual execution time required on the hardware was only 0.07s, achieving over 6000 X acceleration.Furthermore, the ARIES architecture has been extended towards end users and a sample application has been developed to perform rapid term association. This allows users to load their own dataset for analysis and select a set of seed terms of interest.

This fall, our committee of distinguished ML professionals reviewed several nominations sent in from members of the MLconf community. There were several great researchers that were nominated and the committee arrived at awarding 2 students whose work, they believe, has the potential to disrupt the industry in the future. The two winners that were announced at MLconf SF 2015 are UC Irvine Student, Furong Huang and UC Berkeley Student, Virginia Smith. Below are summaries of their research. We've invited both researchers to present their work at upcoming MLconf events.&quot;The citation: &quot; Virginia Smith's research focuses on distributed optimization for large-scale machine learning. The main challenge in many large-scale machine learning tasks is to solve an optimization objective involving data that is distributed across multiple machines. In this setting, optimization methods that work well on single machines must be re-designed to leverage parallel computation while reducing communication costs. This requires developing new distributed optimization methods with both competitive practical performance and strong theoretical convergence guarantees. Virginia's work aims to determine policies for distributed computation that meet these requirements, in particular through the development of a novel primal-dual framework, CoCoA, which is written on Spark. The theoretical and practical development of CoCoA is an important step for future data scientists hoping to deploy efficient large-scale machine learning algorithms.&quot;",https://github.com/gingsmith/cocoaEP/K02339X/1,Acquiring Complete and Editable Outdoor Models from Video and Images,University of Bath,,2013-10-23,2016-10-22,Peter,Hall,Handwriting Annotation and Synthesis Software,Software,No,"The software has two parts:1) Interactive software that helps a user annotate a scanned image of handwritten text, extracting and recognizing the characters (or glyphs) to make them re-usable by the synthesis algorithm.2) Synthesis software that takes a learned model of a specific user's handwriting, and also expects some typed text that the user wishes to render in the handwritten style.

Optional a Homebrew installer for Mac and binary packages for Ubuntu are provided. For unsupported Linux distributions or Windows systems a Virtualbox virtual machine image is now provided as default to distribute the software. This significantly improved the user experience and allows to use BEM++ within a few minutes from downloading.- Reduction of external dependencies. We have cleaned up the code base and removed several external dependencies, making the software much easier to install and maintain.- Redesign of large parts of the library in Python. Originally BEM++ was developed mostly in C++ with a thin Python interface on top. We have reimplemented all non-performance critical parts of the library directly in Python, leaving only low-level assembly loops and multithreaded routines in C++. This has significantly improved the maintainability and extendability of BEM++. One of the postdocs on the project has implemented fast high-frequency preconditioners purely from Python without requiring the need to work in C++.- Development of our own H-Matrix library. Previously, BEM++ depended on the external AHMED software for fast assembly of large-problems. AHMED has a difficult, not open-source compliant license. We have solved this problem by developing our own hierarchical matrix solutions, which performs excellently and is now fully integrated in BEM++. We have solved very large high-frequency problems from high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment with our new library and achieve excellent performance.- Development of various preconditioning techniques. We have implemented high-frequency preconditioners for Helmholtz and opposite order preconditioners for Laplace type problems. These are useful in large-scale application problems. The high-frequency preconditioners have already been used in a real world data engineering application.",2015,"While it is too early to gather precise impact data we are pleased that the main paper describing the BEM++ library, which has appeared in Transactions on Mathematical Software in 2015, has been cited 40 times (Google Scholar citations) in its first year, which is a very high number for Mathematics.

These components can then be linked to form more advanced processes by applying coordination forms to them. Coordination forms allow the specification of richer orchestration than traditional workflow languages and the library is extensible to allow the addition of further coordination forms. Coordination forms can vary from basic structures, such as specifying that a set of dependent components are processed sequentially or that a set of independent components may be processed in parallel, to advanced domain specific languages. A further key benefit of both components and coordination forms specified within the libhpc-cf library is that both can have multiple implementations allowing different approaches to be used to undertake a given task depending on the type of target computing platform to be used or the problem being addressed.",2015,"The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;.

Only the download variants are available to the user (upload variants are used internally within Longbow but developers can make use of them in the API).5. For replicate jobs, the order in which Longbow will search for input files has changed such that it looks in the repX subdirectories before the current working directory.6. The batch parameter has been renamed replicates.7. The commandline parameter has been renamed executableargs.8.

Changed the README.md from markdown format to reStructured text, so now the README is README.rst, this is to make Longbow more pip friendly whilst still being bitbucket and possibly github (in case in future we move).4. setup.py modified to eliminate the python 3 issues, and also the long description is now the README.rst, this means that users will see something standard between the pip page and the bitbucket page, this will also tie in with new pages on the HECBioSim website which will push pip as the preferred way to install more prominently.5. hosts.conf file has been removed from the development version since this is now created on install for new users using pip, this will be marked as deprecated on the website for a while so users on old versions can still get it. Documentation will need to be updated to reflect this change and provide the quickstart example that users can grab a copy of if they are doing a more manual install. However pip will be the encouraged way to install.Issue #115 - Parameters in input files:Parameters specified within the configuration files had to be specified in a very strict format (param = value), users that omitted the spaces would find that Longbow would crash.

Users of power-hungry devices can reduce their energy costs by purchasing power through a Time of Use (ToU) tariff, which is implemented via this new control software that is being developed in the ESCoBox project.  There are a number of ways of doing this, but in the ESCoBox project we have narrowed these down to one option, which is to sell allotted time-slots to high power users.  This is to gain the greatest benefit with the greatest simplicity, as complex arrangements are less likely to be taken up by customers. The program is currently being developed and tested on a Raspbery-Pi platform to allow a low-cost, widely-deployable solution. It is intended that this software will be made Open Source.",2015,"The primary use of this controller will be in implementing time-slot allocations to high power demand loads on power-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from hydro-electric generators.  This technique reduces the chance of overloading the system at peak demand periods by activating power supply circuits to high-power load at  pre-allocated time-slots during off-peak periods.  This allows more customers to be served at lower cost to them, while increasing reliability of the mini-grid and improving the operator's Return on Investment (ROI) by keeping the system running closer to full capacity.  It can also be applied to energy-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from wind or solar generators.  In this situation, the time-slots are sold at preferential rates during periods of high solar (or wind) input.  This reduces reliance on batteries, allowing smaller (and cheaper) battery banks, which are put under much less stress so that they last longer.

It makes use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation techniques and is capable of producing highly detailed construction timelines.DfMA is a simultaneous design and engineering approach where construction components are manufactured and assembled in a controlled factory environment, prior to delivery to a construction site for installation. Precast construction is known as an enhanced method to utilize construction schedule, cost, workforce, safety and quality. DfMA techniques have a significant positive impact on safety, quality and efficiency at every stage of the project. However, prefabrication is not always a better choice than on-site construction methods. For instance, considerable cost overruns and project management issues have each been associated with prefabrication from the manufacturing up to the assembly. The decision on whether or not to prefabricate a building or parts of a building, however, is currently often based more on subjective evidence rather than a thorough analysis of consequential decisions. The available decision making tools either do not cover complete performance attributes while evaluating different construction methods or they do not consider a compromised optimal solution for the overall problem before comparing various construction techniques. Hence, an optimization decision support tool that integrates smaller sub-problems in Manufacturing, Transportation and Assembly (MTA) sectors is developed. Therefore, the individual sub-problems are modelled, combined and optimized according to the overall main objectives of a project. As a result, the optimal solution for different construction techniques can be compared by decision makers before suggesting a recommendation (e.g. Conventional or prefabricated) with an associated level of confidence. In this decision making tool, the holistic MTA system is modelled as a Resource-constrained Complex Flexible Job Shop Scheduling problem with the aim of minimizing the total completion time, cost and the number of on-site workers. A multi-objective GA-based optimization is applied to find a near optimal solution for different construction techniques. This multi-objective GA-based optimization model is developed using the C# programming language with a user-friendly GUI which provides the possibility of defining different levels of prefabrication scenarios.",2014,"This has been one of the first tools of this kind - we have received positive feedback our industrial partners, who are very likely to seek adoption upon the completion of this project.This DfMA Decision Making Tool evaluates the impact of consequential decisions from the manufacturing up to assembly in a multi-objective DfMA project. In DfMA projects, the main objectives are to minimize makespan and cost while maximizing safety, which is included in this tool. Safety is maximized by minimizing the number of on-site workers on congested construction sites. Using the multi-objective GA-based optimization model implemented in this tool, optimal solutions for different levels of prefabrication can be determined and compared with respect to overall time and cost.",EP/L504725/1,Fracture of Graphite Fuel Bricks,University of Manchester,,2013-06-01,2015-11-30,Paul,Mummery,Brick cracking predictor,Software,Yes,Predicts crack paths in graphite fuel bricks,2014,Applications in safety cases for reactors,EP/L505146/1,Transforming the high value joint replacement industry with additive manufacture,Imperial College London (ICL),,2013-11-01,2015-10-31,Justin,Cobb,Automated CAD design,New/Improved Technique/Technology,,This is a technique for automatically designing customised surgical instrumentation based on CT-data and surgical plan information.

Differently from state-of-the-art tools, the implemented thermal simulator has the ability to compute adaptively refined solutions in both space and time, which is an advanced feature for such a thermal simulator. These adaptive features add to the efficiency of our simulator since we can compute more accurate temperature profiles with more efficiency (i.e., less computational cost). The existing thermal simulator makes use of state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the solution of the linear systems arising in computations. The thermal simulator that we have developed so far allows the user to take the details of the integrated circuit floorplan and produce a fully adaptive, transient thermal analysis.

Dedicated to Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES), it can combine the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes. It scales with up to one million cores. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized with finite-difference sixth-order schemes on a Cartesian mesh.  Explicit or semi-implicit temporal schemes can be used for the time advancement depending on the flow configuration. To treat the incompressibility condition, a fractional step method requires to solve a Poisson equation. This equation is fully solved in spectral space via the use of relevant 3D Fast Fourier transforms(FFTs), allowing any kind of boundary conditions for the velocity field in each spatial direction. Using the concept of the modified wavenumber, the divergence free condition is ensured up to machine accuracy.  The pressure field is staggered from the velocity field by half a mesh to avoid spurious oscillations.  The modelling of a solid body inside the computational domain is performed with a customised Immersed Boundary Method. It is based on a direct forcing to ensure a no-slip boundary condition at the wall of the solid body while imposing non-zero velocities inside the solid body to avoid discontinuities on the velocity field. This customised IBM, fully compatible with the 2D domain decomposition and with a possible mesh refinement at the wall, is based on a 1D expansion of the velocity field from fluid regions into solid regions using Lagrange polynomials. To reach realistic Reynolds numbers, an implicit LES strategy can be implemented to solve the Navier-Stokes equations without any extra explicit modelling.
