The Wray PhotoDisplay system is one of the longest 'in the wild' display based deployments from the academic research community. Since 2006 the system has been presented in numerous conferences and journal publications and in invited talks at national and international venues.
The above methodology enabled us to address new, time-dependent problems involving electron-nuclear interactions in atomic wires under very high current densities. The chief result no doubt was the discovery and demonstration of the atomic waterwheel effect, and non-conservative current-driven dynamics in these systems. It generated a new, active and growing, direction in the field as a whole, led to a fruitful ongoing collaboration with colleagues in Denmark and China, and to a substantial further project and grant, led by Dr. D. Dundas.

This work gave us and the international community insights into how fluorescence lifetime can report on cancerous tissue but also on how the signature can vary according to the specific pathology
This endoscope has the potential to enable FLIM to be applied in vivo, including in animal models.  This would permit minimally invasive measurements of, e.g. protein-protein interaction,s that could provide information about disease processes or the effects of therapeutic intervention and would require fewer animals for such studies compared to invasive surgery.
We developed a relatively simple frequency domain lifetime measurement system utilising excitation light from a blue GaN diode laser and have implemented frequency domain detection using a programmable FPGA.  This has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and the size of our instrumentation such that we can make a number of low-cost systems for parallel clinical trials.  This more compact and cheaper instrumentation would also have better prospects to be translated to clinical practice.
The successful trial with this instrument led to further trials with similar instruments being undertaken funded by a new EPSRC project.

Important benefits of new technology are the cost and its ability to survey a larger proportion of the asset stock in much shorter time than when CCTV is used alone. This technology is not intended to replace CCTV completely, but it enables the operators to reduce the survey costs and increase the efficiency and levels of customer service by focusing CCTV on those pipes where need is greatest and managing interventions through measuring objective change. SewerBattTM can also be used to confirm that interventions such as pipe replacement, rehabilitation or cleaning have been carried out to a satisfactory standard. A report commissioning from an independent consultant found that potential savings in the inspection costs from the application of SewerBattTM technology ranging from 35% to 82% could be achieved. These savings enable more focused CCTV inspection to be carried out on a given length of sewer network or permit surveys of larger pipe lengths a given inspection budget.

The prototype is being used for the first time to establish bacterial numbers in a wide range of water samples (including river water and effluent from sewage treatment works).  Preliminary testing, research and prototype development demonstrate the potential of using a portable fluorimeter as an initial screening tool for indicative microbial water quality in disaster relief, and one that is ideally suited to simple pollution scenarios such as assessing the impact of faecal contamination in river or groundwater at specific sites. Furthermore, there is the ability to have both expert interpretation of results as well as simplified pictorial interpretation for use by non-experts in individual communities.  Thus, the innovative approach to improving the efficiency of analysis has the additional benefit of community empowerment through involving poor water users themselves in the application of the technology.

This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques. BBI is interested in a knowledge transfer partnership on this technology.
The technique is being utilized extensively over several research projects, including a collaborative project with Bristol University with interest in correlative light-electron microscopy . It is planned to become part of an imaging facility at Cardiff University.

Latent force models (LFM) are principled approaches to incorporating solutions to differential equations within non- parametric inference methods. Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model (Sarkka et al., 2012; Hartikainen et al. 2012).

By varying the geometry of the droplet generator device and the flow rates of the liquid phases, we could obtain i) monodisperse populations of large droplets with diameters ranging from 11µm to 40µm, ii) monodisperse populations of small droplets with diameters ranging from 5µm to 8µm iii) bidisperse population of main and satellite droplets with diameters ranging from 11µm to 20µm and from 2µm to 4µm, respectively.
By adjusting the oil-brine interfacial tension according to the microfluidic operation required (e.g. droplet generation, transport, storage), we could manufacture monodisperse droplet populations in the low (&lt;10-3N/m) and ultralow (&lt;10-3N/m) interfacial tension regimes with high levels of droplet stability with respect to rupture and coalescence rates.
Two optical traps were used to stretch the droplets by pulling them from two opposite ends. By analysing the droplet deformed shapes under varying salinity and laser power levels, the droplet interfacial tension was qualitatively estimated. Our measurements were in good agreement with the literature data.
Closed-loop networks as well as nanothread Y junctions were achieved.
We combined our microfluidic platform for droplet generation with the analysis of thermally-driven capillary waves, observed at the droplet equatorial plane through bright field microscopy, in order to measure both the droplet interfacial tension and the surfactant film bending rigidity. The microfluidic tensiometry measurements were in good agreement with the literature data.

FWM generation due to its nature and speed immediately adapts to any change in the source, which makes it suitable to work with different original sources without further complications.

High capacity hydrogen storage facility developed
The developed research methods allow for computation of travelling-pulse solutions and of bound-states of such travelling waves in non-local active dissipative systems.  In addition, the developed methods allow for computation of branches of time-periodic solutions in such systems. The methods can therefore be used for a systematic investigation of coherent structures in non-local equations (see e.g. Lin et al. (2015), SIAM J. Appl. Math. 75, 538-563). The methods can also be applied for a more systematics investigation of solutions in local equations, for example, to understand coarsening dynamics in a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation (this is an ongoing work). We expect more impact to be generated in the future.

This rig represents a step-change in experimental techniques available to quantify nanoparticle movement through porous media.  It will allow new conceptual models to be developed and will provide data to constrain mathematical models, providing as it does concentration data anywhere in the column and at any desired time, and in principle information on attached as well as suspended concentrations.  This represents a step change in our ability to reduce the inherent ambiguity of experiments where only the column-end concentration breakthrough curves can be obtained.

in progress; we are now working towards introducing other research groups to the new tools we have developed.
The conceptual model and the software that implements it provide for a new approach in evaluation of database replication protocols. 
The model and the associated software are recent outcomes; we nevertheless envisage that they will be used for the following:
- saving on ICT infrastructure costs and time for measurement. In our own experience, performance measurement takes a lot of time especially if performance needs to be measured under a wide range of conditions (varying workload, load, size of the data processed by the tested system, hardware constraints, etc. Having a model-based approach helps alleviate this.
- evaluating performance variability, i.e. performance is evaluated not as a single number (e.g. throughput), but as a distribution of the measure of interest. This takes very extensive effort in order to get high confidence in the results; our stochastic model may offer dramatic benefits in these circumstances.

Revizto, the software used to bring together the various parts of the model (architecture, objects and additional information) and make it navigable, heard of the project through Twitter and contacted IE to write a case study and suggest ways the software could be developed to suit this type of application. The context for the case study was the re-purposing of the software from a building information management tool, to a visitor experience. This went live on their website (https://revizto.com/en/blog/entry/university-of-reading-merl) in October 2015.
The prototype is a useful tool to demonstrate the novel concept. A patent application based on this design is currently on-going. So the prototype have not been released yet.
This technology has and is strongly benefitting the work both on finished grants and on several studentships connected to grants as outlined in the documentation.

Two vertically and horizontally displaced heat sources/sinks are arranged so that, in the absence of background rotation, statically unstable Rayleigh-Bénard convection would be induced above the source and beneath the sink, thereby relaxing strong constraints placed on background temperature gradients in previous experimental configurations to better mimic in fine local vigorous convection events in tropics and polar regions whilst also facilitating baroclinic motion in midlatitude regions in the Earth's atmosphere.
This new set-up is also a long-term research facility for the gfd lab.

Early stage of exploitation, no impacts yet
This mode of operation is proving useful in several areas of ongoing research work, making possible and contributing directly to publications in preparation.
This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques. BBI is interested in a knowledge transfer partnership on this technology.
The technique is being utilized extensively over several research projects, including a collaborative project with Bristol University with interest in correlative light-electron microscopy . It is planned to become part of an imaging facility at Cardiff University.

Changing way in which research is being communicated
Huge reduction in time and increase in throughput.
Potential impacts are on the improvement of manufacturing efficiency through in-line error measurement and pin-height adjustment by which net-shapes or near-net-shapes of the formed parts could be achieved with higher efficiency and lower cost.
Development of this apparatus and the testing technique has produced results that strongly support the analytical mixed-mode fracture theories that have been developed by the PI. These results have had consequential effects for the on-going development of these theories and have supported the three publications currently listed against this grant.

The developed apparatus is now being frequently used by a PhD student in the research group who is undertaking a comprehensive programme of mixed-mode delamination testing. This student is planning to submit his PhD thesis within the next year.
We are currently publishing the paper (in-revision, neuroimage).
Several publications will be possible thanks to this software.
This system will be available via opendesk.cc, which is has a globally distributed network of 500+ producers many of whom are makespaces or community workshops. It prototypes and validates the potential of mass customisation and local production, including variable pricing and responsible design.

The development and implementation of a multiple-source electron-beam evaporative PVD facility has allowed ternary Al-Cr-Ti based nanostructured coatings to be deposited at high rate - and compared with their equivalents produced using PVD sputter deposition technology.  Also, it presents the capability to deposit quaternary alloy coatings, with further improved mechanical, tribological and corrosion-resistant properties. As a result, new multifunctional coatings have been synthesised which show considerable promise for industrial applications where existing, toxic coatings and processes (involving Cadmium and hexavalent Chromium, particularly) still need to be used in critical load-bearing components, but there is a strong desire to substitute with environmentally benign alternatives.
This is a questionnaire survey. It was originally intended to be used for benchmarking organisations. Potential commercialisation routes or applications were considered after development but none of the project partners involved could take the lead in taking this any further at the time. I occasionally received queries on the tool (details of which are provided on a peer-reviewed journal) but I am not aware whether the tool has been used by third parties.
The TRACER has been extremely useful for studying the new methyl ammonium lead iodide solar cells. For these cells, impedance spectroscopy has turned out to be less than useful, and the TRACER is the only other current method.
