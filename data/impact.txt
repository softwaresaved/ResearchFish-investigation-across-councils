CTL-RP has shown to be a useful addition to the current set of tools available for CTL.
TeMP has been used in a number of contexts in which monodic first-order temporal has been utilised as a specification language.
RMoX was one of several proof-of-concept systems introduced in the late 00s, the impact being to add weight to the feasibility of highly concurrent operating systems (with considerations for multi-core and energy-efficiency) using non-traditional programming languages; a field of research that is increasingly active today.
The development of this scheduler, allowing highly concurrent occam-pi programs to run efficiently on multicore PCs, enabled occam-pi to be used (with huge success) in a number of other research projects.  The low-level scheduling algorithms developed (and released open-source) may have informed development elsewhere.
Demonstrated the feasibility of modelling truly structurally dynamic systems while maintaining computational efficiency through JIT compilation. This has generated interest in the object-oriented modelling community; e.g., commercial languages like Modelica struggle with this.
This is becoming widely used in chemical company research departments to predict rheology of their polymer resins.  It has led to several consultancy agreements, and also to significant ongoing research funding from a chemical company.

&quot;An efficient method for the calculation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics free energies&quot;  Christopher J. Woods, Frederick R. Manby and Adrian J. Mulholland  J. Chem. Phys. 128 014109 (2008) doi:10.1063/1.2805379 The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.
Kheti has had a short feasibility test in the Sironj Crop Producers' Company, a co-operative of small farmers, in Madhya Pradesh, India.

KRoC provides a demonstrator providing proof-of-concept technology for performance scalability (w.r.t. the number of cores) of complex concurrent systems (including real-time and complex modelling).  Although occam-pi is (regrettably) not a `mainstream' system language, the mechanisms developed for its implementation -- that provide efficient and multicore scalability -- and for the verification of the concurrent behaviour of its programmed systems provide targets for mainstream technologies to achieve. Published papers (listed as outcomes from our EPSRC `CoSMoS' research grant) explain the mechanisms developed for this.
We have a user base of several thousand, including most of the major photoacoustic imaging groups from around the world. The question-and-answer forum, which we maintain, is constantly active.

Results for research paper.
Demonstrated effectivity of algorithms in research paper.
The software enables users to rapidly produce bespoke EoS, tailored to their particular application. It will also enable these models to continually evolve as new measurements become available, ensuring that experimental advances are rapidly converted into improved CCS modelling and, ultimately, better performance and efficiency of real CCS processes. During the project a demonstration workshop was held to train potential industrial and academic users on the use of the software.

Ultimately, the tool will make it straightforward for users to continually and rapidly update their EoS in response to emerging experimental data. The resulting EoS will deliver greater range, certainty and computational efficiency in a wide range of CCS modelling. These EoS will contribute to more effective optimisation of CCS, making the process cleaner, safer, more efficient and more economical. This modelling will also be essential to design codes and safety regulations and will provide key modelling support to the urgently required public engagement and consultation on pipeline transport of CO2.

This version of the code was used to run the simulations in &quot;A water-swap reaction coordinate for the calculation of absolute
protein-ligand binding free energies&quot;, Woods, CJ, Malaisree, M, Hannongbua, S &amp; Mulholland, AJ (2011) Journal of Chemical Physics, vol 134, no. 5, 054114 DOI:10.1063/1.3519057, the first application of the WaterSwap method. The accurate prediction of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies is one of the grand challenge problems of computational science. Binding free energy measures the strength of binding between a ligand and a protein, and an algorithm that would allow its accurate prediction would be a powerful tool for rational drug design. Here we present the development of a new method that allows for the absolute binding free energy of a protein-ligand complex to be calculated from first principles, using a single simulation. Our method involves the use of a novel reaction coordinate that swaps a ligand bound to a protein with an equivalent volume of bulk water. This water-swap reaction coordinate is built using an identity constraint, which identifies a cluster of water molecules from bulk water that occupies the same volume as the ligand in the protein active site. A dual topology algorithm is then used to swap the ligand from the active site with the identified water cluster from bulk water. The free energy is then calculated using replica exchange thermodynamic integration. This returns the free energy change of simultaneously transferring the ligand to bulk water, as an equivalent volume of bulk water is transferred back to the protein active site. This, directly, is the absolute binding free energy. It should be noted that while this reaction coordinate models the binding process directly, an accurate force field and sufficient sampling are still required to allow for the binding free energy to be predicted correctly. In this paper we present the details and development of this method, and demonstrate how the potential of mean force along the water-swap coordinate can be improved by calibrating the soft-core Coulomb and Lennard-Jones parameters used for the dual topology calculation. The optimal parameters were applied to calculations of protein-ligand binding free energies of a neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir), with these results compared to experiment. These results demonstrate that the water-swap coordinate provides a viable and potentially powerful new route for the prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies.

ELK is used to provide reasoning services in Snow Owl, a state-of-the-art authoring platform for clinical terminologies marketed by B2i Healthcare (see http://www.b2international.com/portal/snow-owl). 

According to their product description:

&quot;ELK, Snow Owl's default reasoner, performs description logic classification in parallel on modern multi-core computers. This allows the full international SNOMED CT plus the Australian extensions (830,926 relationships) to be classified and checked for equivalencies in about 10 seconds on a modern desktop computer.&quot;

ELK is also used by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies consortium (OBO), whose OBO &quot;foundry&quot; contains a large number of &quot;orthogonal interoperable reference ontologies in the biomedical domain&quot;. ELK is used in OBO authoring tools, and it is run continuously by the foundry to check that the foundry ontologies are consistent, both individually and when integrated into a single large ontology.
The PPL was originally released in 2001.
The software was used in the Victorian State Election November 2014 to capture and process votes.
The software covers two separate models for spatial analysis; the Space Syntax model and the Agent model. These two models are theoretically different in spite of the fact that they agree on the principal relationship between space and society. They start from different representations, and they diverge at the point of modelling. The agent model represents an emergent process that leads to form aggregate patterns of movement activity. Through its ability to display movement data in relation to aggregate patterns of agents, depthmapX's agents have proven to be an effective tool to simulate natural movement. Space Syntax builds on a synchronic reduction of spatial relationships in the built environment. Mapping this reduction into networks of longest and fewest lines, depthmapX's axial and segment analyses are powerful methods for predicting to-movement and through-movement in cities. On the scale of buildings, spatial analysis using depthmapX can reveal relational structures that convey how social organisations occupy spaces. depthmapX is a platform that brings together these too models to be tested in an analytical approach. It also affords experimental and developer approaches.

The current usage of this software has proven to engage different types of academic communities that have a language in common with the notion of space. These communities range between planners, designers, social scientists, anthropologists, crime scientists, geographers, computer scientists and economists. In general terms, all what brings together the social and the spatial. In different contexts, spatial modelling using depthmapX can help forming assumptions about social behaviour in space and model spatial and social relationships. Moreover, depthmapX significance exceeds its common usage as an analytical tool to understand the built environment on different scales and go beyond that to act as a design and decision making support tool. The intelligent usage of software will deploy it in supporting design process with a knowledge-base that is suggested to make designs more responsive towards the real settings of the built environment. In simple terms, depthmapX is increasingly used as a tool for design thinking. By using it efficiently, the software helps on sparing time and cost, particularly on the scale of complex buildings and large scale urban planning.
Currently the "Space Syntax Toolkit" consists of two modules: "Graph analysis" and "Attributes explorer". The "Graph analysis" module supports the verification and analysis of the spatial network model. This consists of an axial map layer, representing the urban street network, and an unlinks layer, indicating bridges and tunnels with no level crossing. The module offers a verification tool to check the geometric and topological integrity of each layer, helping correct any problems before running the analysis. The axial and segment analysis is performed in depthmapXnet, via a direct link from QGIS, which receives and prepares the results once the calculations are completed. The "Attributes explorer" module supports the visual and statistical exploration of the analysis results. It provides quick analysis of individual quantitative attributes of a selected layer, mapping the values using simplified symbology settings, displaying essential descriptive statistics, and plotting basic interactive charts (histogram and scatter plot).

The main scientific code developments and scientific outputs will be described in the UCL and OU UK-RAMP grant outputs (publications particularly relevant to DL are included in the 'publications' outputs. We note here that the main paper describing the project (Carr et al 2012) has so far been referenced 43 times as of February 2015.
The impacts have mainly been academic (with commercial use of UKRMol through the company Quantemol Ltd: see the UCL UK-RAMP outpus and the UK-RAMP case for support). The upgrading of the codebase is significant for future development of UKRMol (see the OU UK-RAMP outputs).  
One more general impact is that the CCPQ flagship project on Tensor Network Theory (TNT: http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/tntlibrary/) has fully embraced the 'best practice' outlook established for UKRMol and has developed substantially as a result. Other CCPQ projects have also taken on board these ideas.

In addition, the UK-RAMP work and expertise lead to further parallelization work of the UKRMol-out resonance-finding TIMEDEL module, funded by PRACE development effort. A PRACE white paper on this is included in the publications list: further development has greatly extended the parallelism, with much wider applications, and a joint paper on the serial and parallel TIMEDEL module is due to be submitted/published in 2016.
With respect to UK-RAMP, the UKRMol interface was sucessfully developed and the code has been used to enable massively parallel molecular calculations (already, two specific application papers as of autumn 2014 are included as UK-RAMP publication). The collaboration with CCPQ core support enabled a dCSE project on the PRMAT inner region codes and PRACE 2IP funding for further optimization of PFARM (the latter is considered a CCPQ-core extra funding but the output has relevance for UK-RAMP applications: publications/presentations describing PFARM on novel technology platforms are included in the portfolio, and PFARM has demonstrated efficient performance on a heterogeneous Xeon-Phi platform. The expertise will, post-UK-RAMP be extended to the rest of UKRMol. The PRMAT inner region developments were relevant to a QUB (with DL) ARCHER eCSE project for Tier-0 level optimization of RMT (see separate collaboration entry). As part of further CCPQ core support funded development, a double-continuum version of the inner region codes is being developed over the course of 2015-2016. PFARM is being benchmarked against a separate R-matrix package (PSTGF) for both performance and results. The results agreement is good for calculations in which PSTGF's approximations are considered valid, and performance is competitive although PFARM uses fewer approximations.
This software reflects the outcomes of the PhD Thesis &quot;Reliable Massively Parallel Symbolic Computing Fault Tolerance for a Distributed Haskell&quot; by Rob Stewart, Heriot-Watt University, November 2013.
This software provides enabling technology for high-level parallel programming, and was the basis for the measurements of challenging parallel symbolic applications on the HECToR super-computer.
This package represents a revision of the evaluation strategies module for controlling parallelism in Glasgow parallel Haskell (GpH). Since GpH can be used on both shared and distributed memory platforms, it is a widely used dialect of Haskell.
This serialisation component provides key functionality to the HdpH software technology, which is the main software output of the project. Serialisation is also of interest in isolation, therefore this module was published separately as well.

Xen has thrown open the doors to experimental new operating systems such as ours, and it is fitting that we (as Xen developers too) improve the state of cloud management toolstacks. Many of the Mirage 1.0 libraries (such as the device driver implementations) are being used in XenServer as part of the disaggregation of the monolithic driver domain into multiple, less-privileged &quot;stub domains&quot;. While the low-level plumbing for stub domains has existed for some years, they are difficult to build and debug in practise. Mirage's first major application is to transform the XAPI control stack into a standalone distributed system that can run an entire cluster of hosts with a greater degree of reliability, security and scalability than exists today.

This software provides the first capability to link via a unique mathematical mapping (as developed in associated publications) the regularity of a grain structure generated by Voronoi tessellation and three simple, measurable parameters: maximum, minimum and average grain size; this is the so-called Controlled Poisson Voronoi tessellation. Furthermore, the software can automatically generate cohesive zones along grain boundaries for the first time, including at multiple junctions (as developed in associated publications).

Important benefits of new technology are the cost and its ability to survey a larger proportion of the asset stock in much shorter time than when CCTV is used alone. This technology is not intended to replace CCTV completely, but it enables the operators to reduce the survey costs and increase the efficiency and levels of customer service by focusing CCTV on those pipes where need is greatest and managing interventions through measuring objective change. SewerBattTM can also be used to confirm that interventions such as pipe replacement, rehabilitation or cleaning have been carried out to a satisfactory standard. A report commissioning from an independent consultant found that potential savings in the inspection costs from the application of SewerBattTM technology ranging from 35% to 82% could be achieved. These savings enable more focused CCTV inspection to be carried out on a given length of sewer network or permit surveys of larger pipe lengths a given inspection budget.

This software package is a new release of one of a handful of 'recommended' packages supplied with the base distribution of R. Previous versions have been widely used in a wide range of applications, particularly in ecology and natural resource management, as well as medicine, epidemiology and economics. For example the energy company EDF use the methods for electricity load forecasting. In addition the package is currently used by 102 other software packages for R. For example the underlying fitting methods are sufficiently general that they can be efficiently leveraged for functional data analysis, as in the 'refund' package.
Traditional capture-recapture approaches to estimating animal abundance or density ignore an obvious spatial component of capture probability; organisms close to traps are more likely to be captured than those that are far away. Explicitly accounting for an individual's location provides additional information from which to infer animal density. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have been developed for this purpose. An advantage of these over traditional capture-recapture methodology is that they allow for animal density estimation using passive detectors (e.g., cameras or microphones) over a single sampling occasion.

AD Model Builder (ADMB) is a statisical software package most widely used for nonlinear modelling, and is well suited to the implementation of maximum likelihood SECR methods. Although growing in popularity since becoming freely available, open-source software in 2008, ADMB is used by a minority of statisticians and ecologists, who, in general, are far more comfortable with the popular programming language and software environment R.

The aim of admbsecr is to enable a user is able to fit SECR models that incorporate additional spatial information, using ADMB to fit the model and return the results to the R session.

The application is open-source. NLP on social media data is hard. Content is often brief, contains mistakes, lacks context, and is uncurated - very different from the well-formed news text that tools typically operate over. TwitIE is a GATE pipeline for Information Extraction over tweets, one of the noisiest forms of social media text.
The tagger is available open-source. Part-of-speech tagging tweets is hard. The tagger achieves competitive accuracy, and uses the Penn Treebank tagset, so that all other tools should integrate seamlessly.
The application is open-source. Crowdsourcing is an increasingly popular, collaborative approach for acquiring annotated corpora. Despite this, reuse of corpus conversion tools and user interfaces between projects is still problematic, since these are not generally made available. The GATE Crowdsourcing plugin offers infrastructural support for mapping documents to crowdsourcing units and back, as well as automatically generating reusable crowdsourcing interfaces for NLP classification and sequence annotation tasks.
The method is currently distributed with ONETEP, which in turn is distributed via both academic license and commercial license within the &quot;Materials Studio&quot; package by BIOVIA. Three papers based on the software development work are currently under review.
Quantitative determination of concentration of chemical components (lipids, proteins, DNA) and their spatial distribution in cells and tissues from label-free hyperspectral CARS microscopy data. The software has been made freely available, and has been utilized by several groups. It is also applicable beyond CARS data, to any dataset that requires a decomposition analysis (eg fluorescence spectra). It is becoming part of an image analysis suite embedded in an institutional image facility.
Since its introduction the technique has been widely used (by our and other labs) to 
1) measure the volume of transparent particles, such as nanodiamonds
2) measure the thickness of lipid bilayers both suspended and surface attached
3) measure the thickness of thin dielectric layers for waveguide design and processing
This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques. BBI is interested in a knowledge transfer partnership on this technology.
The technique is being utilized extensively over several research projects, including a collaborative project with Bristol University with interest in correlative light-electron microscopy . It is planned to become part of an imaging facility at Cardiff University.

The main impact we envisage for MetiTarski is in the formal verification of software and other engineering systems.  To this end we have integrated MetiTarski into other formal verification tools such as the KeYmaera and PVS theorem provers and the Why3 software verification toolkit.  At the current time the case studies that have been undertaken which involve use of these tools in conjunction with MetiTarski are all of a preliminary experimental nature.

Latent force models (LFM) are principled approaches to incorporating solutions to differential equations within non- parametric inference methods. Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model (Sarkka et al., 2012; Hartikainen et al. 2012).
In a nutshell, the framework contains the code for modelling smart homes and communities. Also, it comes with two additional toolkits for optimisation and visualisation for smart home and community data.

The declarative style of the YAML metadata used to configure the library provides a simplified means for developers and end-user scientists and researchers to specify their jobs and switch much more easily between cluster and cloud platforms. For example, where users wish to undertake some jobs on a local cluster platform and take advantage of cloud infrastructure for other aspects of their workload, the libhpc deployer provides support for straightforwardly selecting a different target platform on a per-job basis.
The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;.

Mutation Reduces Drug Binding Affinity&quot; Scientific Reports, doi:10.1038/srep03561 The emergence of a novel H7N9 avian influenza that infects humans is a serious cause for concern. Of the genome sequences of H7N9 neuraminidase available, one contains a substitution of arginine to lysine at position 292, suggesting a potential for reduced drug binding efficacy. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir bound to H7N9, H7N9-R292K, and a structurally related H11N9 neuraminidase. They show that H7N9 neuraminidase is structurally homologous to H11N9, binding the drugs in identical modes. The simulations reveal that the R292K mutation disrupts drug binding in H7N9 in a comparable manner to that observed experimentally for H11N9-R292K. Absolute binding free energy calculations with the WaterSwap method confirm a reduction in binding affinity. This indicates that the efficacy of antiviral drugs against H7N9-R292K will be reduced. Simulations can assist in predicting disruption of binding caused by mutations in neuraminidase, thereby providing a computational 'assay.'

Festival is distributed as default in a number of standard Linux distributions including Arch Linux, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Scientific Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, Mandriva, Mageia and Slackware, and can easily be installed on any Linux distribution that supports apt-get.  More recently our work on statistical parametric speech synthesis and the algorithms for adaptation have been incorporated in the HTS toolkit (one of the coordinators (Yamagishi) is from Edinburgh), which integrates with Festival. These toolkits are the most used open-source speech synthesis systems and have also formed the high performing baseline systems for the international Blizzard evaluation of (commercial and research) speech synthesis also organised by Edinburgh.
The HTS toolkit is used worldwide by both academic and commercial organisations, such as Microsoft, Nuance, Toshiba, Pentax, and Google. The number of downloads of HTS exceeds 10,000 and various commercial products using HTS are on the market. Therefore, this toolkit is a very influential platform for me to disseminate outcomes and form an immediate pathway to impact.

This required the processing of more than 1600 hours of BBC TV audio data and developing systems for transcription, subtitle alignment and diarisation. This was embodied in 4 tasks in the MGB challenge, and Cambridge University systems based on HTK 3.5 had the best performance for all these tasks.

Many HTK users have downloaded HTK 3.5 and are actively using it to develop both research and commercial systems.
This software was used to train RNNLMs that were used in the Cambridge University transcription systems used in the 2015 ASRU multi-genre broadcast challenge (international challenge involving the automatic transcription of BBC broadcast audio). The Cambridge system gave the lowest error rates in the challenge and the use of RNNLMs efficiently trained on a large corpus of subtitle material was a key component, as well as the use of topic adaptation.

Mimic condition-monitoring software allows ship operators to base maintenance decisions on condition and performance rather than on recommended time basis. The company sought to expand its monitoring capabilities across the whole ship, with a particular focus on fuel use.

The result of the collaboration is a system that the partners say could "revolutionise fuel efficiency" and offer major improvements in maintenance planning for Mimic clients. The technology can be retro-fitted to most ships, meaning a very broad potential impact from the research.

The HTS toolkit is used worldwide by both academic and commercial organisations, such as Microsoft, Nuance, Toshiba, Pentax, and Google. The number of downloads of HTS exceeds 10,000 and various commercial products using HTS are on the market. Therefore, this toolkit is a very influential platform for me to disseminate outcomes and form an immediate pathway to impact.
Softwares similar to this do indeed exist: the ERC project COMPOSES of Marco Baroni from  the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences of the University of Trento is one such example. But it is the first time that one can input different copora and datasets, as well as normalization schemes, and compare the performances of models across all the parameters, and further, display the results graphically.
We are currently able to calculate momentum densities. Hopefully, other researchers around the world will also be able to use our contribution to help interpret their experimental data.

Anecdotally, the wiki has become widely used in the CRNT community. This was visible recently at a CRNT workshop in Portsmouth, where we found that a variety of academics from the UK, Europe and North America all regularly use it as a reference tool when writing papers in this area. One expected long term result is a harmonisation of language and basic assumptions across CRNT research communities with somewhat different frameworks and histories, allowing greater scope for collaboration and communication between these communities.
The tool, which is under continuous development, has become quite widely used within the chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) community. Development has also been opened up to the wider community and modules have subsequently been added by researchers not originally part of the development team. The goal is both to allow new results which naturally take algorithmic forms to be made widely available, and to provide an open source alternative to some of the closed source CRN analysis software currently available. We expect long term impact to be significant.

An outstanding feature of our approach is that the control techniques we are developing are solely based on input-output data readouts from the network, with the goal to provide optimal and robust operation of potentially poorly characterised or unknown networks. We call such an approach data-based optimal control as opposed to more classical model-based approaches. Data-based methods aim to infer/learn a feedback optimal control law from input-output data collected from the system, i.e., from the way the output of the system reacts to various perturbations at the input of the system.
Prediction and control of behaviour and abnormalities in any complex dynamical network, and in particular in those encountered in biology require the development of multivariate predictive models that integrate large dataset from different sources. Although, a large amount of data are being collected on a daily basis, very few methods allow the automatic creation from these data of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation models for understanding and (re-)design/control, and an inordinate amount of time is still being spent on the manual aggregation of information and expert development of models that explains these data.

In this context, the problem of reconstruction or identification of biological systems from experimental time series data is of fundamental importance. Yet, the development of general reconstruction techniques remains challenging, especially for nonlinear system identification. We are currently developing new methods to identify both parametric structure and parameter values in nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation models from heterogeneous datasets. Applications of such nonlinear systems identification methods cover fundamental questions in systems biology, synthetic biology (debugging and design of cellular systems) and modelling of complex dynamical networks.

Initial studies in November 2013, using scans of fragments of a synthetic fresco, have shown that the user feedback collected that way is effective and helps increasing the quality of our match suggestions to conservators who reassemble a shattered wallpainting. The next step of evaluation, required to finalise the app, will be to run the system alongside the assembly of a Late-Bronze-Age fresco that has not been assembled previously. However, due to local constraints on site, it was not possible to conduct this experiment with our partners at the Akrotiri excavation. We still plan to run the fully-fledged study as soon as the situation on site has changed (hopefully in summer 2015), which will aim at including the regular visitors to the Akrotiri excavation as test subjects, too. Ultimately, we believe that the software will be able to assist various assembly projects in cultural heritage applications, and that its development will spawn additional, similar projects.
The software has been successful in bringing industrial funding and consultancies into the laboratory. Some elements are licensed when used commercially.
ONETEP is continually developed and new, updated versions are released on an annual basis.

The system provides 3 key elements:
1) A timeline which provides instinctive chronological flexibility consisting of multiple arrays of time-scales - days, hours and minutes. The user can expand or contract the timeline allowing the user to manipulate the volume of displayed documents. 
2) A zooming functionality, created by fixing a camera to the 2D x-plane in the 3D environment, facilitates user controlled data convergence. This allows users to zoom in and out of the Z-axis which changes the distance of the camera plane in relation to the displayed objects. The user can control the amount of documents currently on display by the system. Furthermore, it allows the user to focus on clusters of documents that may be of particular interest.
3) The visualisation of information through inter-document relationships. The system database contains a vast range of data which is used by the system to create arrays of objects which have underlying connections. These relationships are used to generate the default GUI.  The goal of exploiting the underlying relationships is to allow the user to quickly retrieve information based on whatever knowledge they have relating to the search.

new collaborations with various physical chemistry groups; concrete impacts likely to be realised over the coming months.
The conceptual model and the software that implements it provide for a new approach in evaluation of database replication protocols. 
The model and the associated software are recent outcomes; we nevertheless envisage that they will be used for the following:
- saving on ICT infrastructure costs and time for measurement. In our own experience, performance measurement takes a lot of time especially if performance needs to be measured under a wide range of conditions (varying workload, load, size of the data processed by the tested system, hardware constraints, etc. Having a model-based approach helps alleviate this.
- evaluating performance variability, i.e. performance is evaluated not as a single number (e.g. throughput), but as a distribution of the measure of interest. This takes very extensive effort in order to get high confidence in the results; our stochastic model may offer dramatic benefits in these circumstances.

This software package is one of a handful of 'recommended' packages supplied with the base distribution of R. Previous versions have been widely used in a wide range of applications, particularly in ecology and natural resource management, as well as medicine, epidemiology and economics. For example the energy company EDF use the methods for electricity load forecasting. In addition the package is currently used by 102 other software packages for R. For example the underlying fitting methods are sufficiently general that they can be efficiently leveraged for functional data analysis, as in the 'refund' package.
Used for energy load prediction problems by EDF (France). Collaboration with EDF to improve methods for this purpose.
The STIR software package has a relatively large user base; the additions are mainly of interest to the small but expanding community who have PET/MR and who wish to experiment with alternative reconstruction algorithms.

Enables vehicle fleet owners to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions
This package has been trialed by industrial partners and shown to provide a 7% reduction in fuel consumption for highway operations.  The package is manufactured by a UK trailer manufacturer and is currently being implemented by two major UK fleets.  An estimated 50 vehicles have been fitted with this modification so far, with a rapidly increasing take-up.
This vehicle has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 40% compared with conventional urban delivery vehicles.

Bela has gained significant traction amongst researchers, musicians and hobbyists in the 2014-16 period. 

On 29 February 2016, we launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Bela, seeking £5k to build and distribute the hardware. We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign) and as of one week later, we have raised more than £31k with over three weeks remaining. So far there are 320 backers of the campaign, and we have received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands) and industry (ROLI, who are interested in supporting their JUCE environment).

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL). At this point (excluding the Kickstarter campaign) roughly 30 people in Europe and North America (majority researchers, some industry members, some musicians) have bought Bela hardware from us.
From a commercial perspective, the app provides a slick demonstrator for potential investors without the overhead of digging deep into mobile platforms. The app was presented during Queen Mary University of London's School of Elec. Eng. and Computer Sc. Research Showcase (3 April 2014) which attracted a lot of visitors including many industrials. The app raised the interest of our partners Omniphone and Abbey Road Studios we collaborate with on research projects. We demonstrated the app to Rocket Music, a company founded by Elton John, and are currently in discussion with them to create a new digital music product.
From a pedagogical perspective, the SoundBite app represents a useful way to introduce UG and PG students to some of the Music Information Retrieval technologies developed by Queen Mary University of London.

However, our work on MPEG-A: Interactive Music Application Format (IM AF) has inspired not only commercial products such as STEMS by Native Instruments but also artists such as Emilio Molina Martínez (ES),  Tracy Redhead (AU) &amp; Imogen Heap (UK) releasing raw music material (i.e., multi-track audio, lyrics, album cover and credits) suitable for IM AF encoding.
The tool was the first to implement an automata based approach to the verification of higher-order recursion schemes.  It also was the first to use a &amp;quot;saturation&amp;quot; method.  The tool showed that this approach is competitive with existing approaches and inspired a further tool (HORSAT) to be produced by Naoki Kobayashi's group in Tokyo, using similar techniques.

Universities participating in the Student Switch-Off Campaign are having to install automatic meter readings via SMART meters. Whilst there is a only a sample of EU Universities at present this still equates to: 
8% average reduction of electricity usage, compared to baseline year, across
participating dormitories
• 4.23GWh electricity-savings (1,902CO2e / 364toe) achieved, compared to baseline
year, across participating dormitories, over both academic years
• 3,773 students (15% of those in dormitories) living in participating dormitories
recruited as energy champions each academic year. 7,547 students (30%) engage with
the project each academic year
• Quantifiable behaviour change delivered in students, with 10% swings on target
behaviours (e.g. students switching off the lights when not in use) between surveys. 90%
of students state they have carried forward the energy-saving habits learnt in the project
into private accommodation once they have left dormitories
• 2.85GWh estimated energy savings (1,284tCO2e/year / 245 toe) from students
carrying forward their energy-saving habits into private accommodation
• Project continues to expand on a self-funded basis, reaching 257,805 students in six
European countries by Sept 2016
The notable impacts resulting from the application of the software is the generation of real-world applicable decision support outputs which directly inform the current draft planning documents for a number of Western Australian recovery catchments.
The use of this app in a rural rather than urban environment further allowed the research team to investigate its benefits and limitations, while also introducing the technology to a new audience.
The final version of the app allowed for continuity to be examined between users of Greendoors 2013 and Greendoors 2014, e.g. did familiarity with the app encourage a larger number of downloads or more indepth use?
This version of the app was greatly improved from the first iteration, and the creation of live reports allowed users to get the information they requested in a more timely fashion.
Users of the Greendoors app were able to access additional information about retrofitting measures, thereby making the research process much easier.
The software is being used by local community as Peat Trade
School pupils and teachers gain an understanding of how much and where energy is being used in their school over a week. Data allows comparison between school days, and subject areas. This is supported by teaching material that encourages further discovery and discussion around the value of energy.

The app will be rolled out to 20 schools in Edinburgh as part of an energy awareness campaign.
Tools for experimental optimisation by analysis of preliminary structure results are included in the CRYSTALS software package. We are currently writing up the theory and applied examples with recommendations to allow other groups to follow the methods.
Existing software tools for designing crystallographic experiments are often closed-source and are limited to standard experiments. Scientists are left with great challenges to exploit new instrument technology for non-standard data collections like photo­crystallography. The tools presented here have been used to create experiment strategies in-house and at Diamond Light Source, by Oxford researchers and by beamline staff. The software has also been used to support developments of a time-resolved crystallography instrument at University of Nancy.
Academic highlights include the theoretical prediction of the existence of graphane; theoretical prediction of new stable high-pressure phases of aluminium, ammonia, nitrogen, water, hydrogen and carbon; electronic defect modelling in many important semiconductors;  growth of polar oxides; see http://www.castep.org/CASTEP/ResearchHighlights for more.

Industrial impact is often kept secret - but can see CASTEP cited in over 70 patent applications in recent years.
There has been increased engagement on social media (Blue-Green Cities twitter feed and LinkedIn Group) since the Blue-Green Cities website was released. The website also provides an outlet for BGC outputs (conference and journal papers) to be downloaded, thus enabling the research findings to be disseminated to a wider community. Requests for information on the project have also directly come through the website.

To date, the developed software has only been evaluated with a small user group of parents. They have used the prototype to maintain a digital record of daily behaviours, exhibited by one or more of their children. 

Qualitative feedback (please see key findings description section) supports envisaged benefits of use of this tool as an interactive assistive technology for streamlining and augmenting data collection procedures within the home environment and / or other pertinent environment, such as the classroom. 

Initial findings from this research have been reported at the 12th International Conference On Smart home and health Telematics (ICOST), held in Denver, USA. Please refer to the Engagement Activities section for further information.
The developed web tool automates many of the manual processes currently employed by parents and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) within a home-based autism intervention setting. Specifically, the tool provides instant visualisation of recorded data through the provision of a user driven user interface that aggregates, summarises and showcases clinically important patterns in behaviour. These visualisation services alone offer significant potential for increasing BA's ability to discover behaviour patterns and to subsequently introduce more timely home-based intervention treatments. 

The visualisation service is further supported via a data mining service that highlights (based on the application of association rule modelling) the 'predicted' causes and effects of particular behaviour by mining previously recorded data from one or more individuals with autism. The service, while requiring further validation through longer user evaluations to generate more data, has the potential to reduce the workload of BAs by supporting them with functional analysis of a child's behaviour.
The public release was within the past 6 months, so impact is only starting to feed through.  I have been contacted by academics using the software to explore homomorphic encryption for the first time, becoming interested in the potential for its use in statistics and machine learning.  A startup company, Numerai, have also been in contact and are exploring its use in sharing sensitive data to designers of proprietary algorithms, where both parties require privacy.

The CoCoA [NIPS 2014] / CoCoA+ [ICML 2015] distributed optimization algorithm developed in a duo of papers with two co-authors from Edinburgh (Martin Takáč, myself) has won the MLconf Industry Impact Student Research Award. The award goes to our coauthor Virginia Smith (UC Berkeley). Other co-authors: M. Jaggi (ETH Zurich), M.I. Jordan (Berkeley), C. Ma (Lehigh), J. Terhorst (UC Berkeley), S. Krishnan (UC Berkeley), T. Hofmann (ETH Zurich).

About the award: &quot;This year, we started a new award program called the MLconf Industry Impact Student Research Award, which is sponsored by Google. This fall, our committee of distinguished ML professionals reviewed several nominations sent in from members of the MLconf community. There were several great researchers that were nominated and the committee arrived at awarding 2 students whose work, they believe, has the potential to disrupt the industry in the future. The two winners that were announced at MLconf SF 2015 are UC Irvine Student, Furong Huang and UC Berkeley Student, Virginia Smith. Below are summaries of their research. We've invited both researchers to present their work at upcoming MLconf events.&quot;

The citation: &quot; Virginia Smith's research focuses on distributed optimization for large-scale machine learning. The main challenge in many large-scale machine learning tasks is to solve an optimization objective involving data that is distributed across multiple machines. In this setting, optimization methods that work well on single machines must be re-designed to leverage parallel computation while reducing communication costs. This requires developing new distributed optimization methods with both competitive practical performance and strong theoretical convergence guarantees. Virginia's work aims to determine policies for distributed computation that meet these requirements, in particular through the development of a novel primal-dual framework, CoCoA, which is written on Spark. The theoretical and practical development of CoCoA is an important step for future data scientists hoping to deploy efficient large-scale machine learning algorithms.&quot;

Range of geometries on which the library's Nedelec implementation if valid has been vastly improved. Previously only rectangular-faced geometries were possible.
A journal article has been submitted to Computers and Structures and is under review.
The code has been provided to our collaborators in Cardiff University who intend to develop a parallel version of the software.
This addition to deal.II allows for the solution of electromagnetic problems using Nedelec on meshes that do not conform to its standard convention. This includes meshes generated externally using external mesh generators as well as certain classes of geometries (e.g. spheres) built by within the deal.II library. As written above, the implemented basis function set also lends itself to efficient preconditioners for problems in electromagnetism, including eddy current problems.
This demo has just been released this year. The source code is available at the demonstration web site.

Two vertically and horizontally displaced heat sources/sinks are arranged so that, in the absence of background rotation, statically unstable Rayleigh-Bénard convection would be induced above the source and beneath the sink, thereby relaxing strong constraints placed on background temperature gradients in previous experimental configurations to better mimic in fine local vigorous convection events in tropics and polar regions whilst also facilitating baroclinic motion in midlatitude regions in the Earth's atmosphere.

Bela has gained significant traction amongst researchers, musicians and hobbyists in the 2014-16 period. 

On 29 February 2016, we launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Bela, seeking £5k to build and distribute the hardware. We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign) and as of one week later, we have raised more than £31k with over three weeks remaining. So far there are 320 backers of the campaign, and we have received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands) and industry (ROLI, who are interested in supporting their JUCE environment).

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL). At this point (excluding the Kickstarter campaign) roughly 30 people in Europe and North America (majority researchers, some industry members, some musicians) have bought Bela hardware from us.

not aware of any impacts yet
We're currently in the process of further developing the software to test with users.
The application is currently being distributed among local communities within Newcastle with a view to wider expansion in the future. We are still in the early stages of distribution and therefore no impact has been recorded.
The simulation macros have been used extensively by both academics and industrial engineers; the research paper that launched the simulation package has been cited more than 185 times --giving some indication of the extent. Support on using the macros (this generally takes the form of answering e-mailed question received) is still on going (in 2016).
The tracker allow us to see where scooter users are travelling but also what were the noise levels in the area, how polluted was the place and how rough the surface of the terrain was.

While it is too early to gather precise impact data we are pleased that the main paper describing the BEM++ library, which has appeared in Transactions on Mathematical Software in 2015, has been cited 40 times (Google Scholar citations) in its first year, which is a very high number for Mathematics. Also, we regularly observe now other groups at conferences presenting results based on BEM++. As time progresses the citation count of the main BEM++ paper will be some measure on how widely the software continues to be used.
This software library has been used widely in our group for tensor network simulations, as well as being downloaded by users in other groups/institutions for use in their own calculations.

TNT Go was demonstrated at various summer schools as a way of generating interest in the TNT library project and providing an easy to use introduction to performing simulations using the TNT algorithms. This is the first web tool we are aware of that allows TNT simulations to be carried out without the need for any software to be installed by the user.
The web portal went live late last year but the back-end simulation software continues to be developed as part of a linked project led by UCL. It is expected that impact will be realised when the calculations performed on the back-end become more advanced and so further value is created in uploading structures to the database. It should be noted that structures uploaded today can and will have additional properties calculated and uploaded as the back-end simulation code develops further.

TemPSS makes use of the concepts of software parameter templates and application profiles. Templates represent the parameter decision space of an application while profiles provide instantiations of a template with parameters specific to a particular job or task to be accomplished with the target application. Significantly, TemPSS allows the creation of partial profiles - incomplete sets of parameters - and supports collaboration between different entities who can each partially instantiate a profile with the parameters that they understand how to specify optimally. An end-user can then be presented with an almost complete profile that they can finalise to run the target application.
The declarative style of the YAML metadata used to configure the library provides a simplified means for developers and end-user scientists and researchers to specify their jobs and switch much more easily between cluster and cloud platforms. For example, where users wish to undertake some jobs on a local cluster platform and take advantage of cloud infrastructure for other aspects of their workload, the libhpc deployer provides support for straightforwardly selecting a different target platform on a per-job basis.
The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;. The library offers a demonstration of the differences and power of coordination forms when compared to existing workflow languages or systems. The ability to handle multiple implementations of software components and the orchestration processes used to control them is of particular use in modern heterogeneous computing environments.

Since the release of the first version of Longbow, there have been just over 400 verified unique downloads between the HECBioSim download repository and the Python PyPi index. The active user-base includes users from both academic (21 different institutions in the UK) and the industrial sector globally.

Longbow has also been or is currently being incorporated into software pipelines of other groups/consortia, projects of notable progress include integrating with FLEX-EM a powerful tool developed by CCP-EM and FESetup developed by CCPBioSim. The Longbow project led to a collaboration with pharmaceutical company UCB into integration of Longbow into their workflow, this also led to a feasibility study into the construction of a similar tool for commercial cloud services such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure.
This tool has proved to be quite popular amongst the academic community, feedback from members of the community has been very positive for this tool with requests to expand to more codes being quite common. The tool has helped groups that do not have a traditional background in HPC to make sense of the often quite daunting application process for super computing time. Usage statistics from this tool suggest it has been utilised by 1,343 unique IP addresses globally and that users are likely to be making use of this tool for systems that are very similar to ARCHER.

Other sections of the website seeing heavy use are the software download and the documentation repositories.
This open source code has only just been released - thus impact is not known at this stage.
A large (approx 100)  number of international users are now using the code.
LB3D has been used to study self-assembly of cubic phases, micro-mixing, flow through porous media, fluid surface interactions and other problems in complex fluidics. In addition, we have implemented the moment propagation method in LB3D, which allows us to efficiently measure the effective diffusion, dispersion, and other transport properties of ionic species in electrokinetic flows. These developments have enabled us to reveal interesting phenomena in charged rocks, namely a non-monotonic dispersion coefficient and a crossover in the effective diffusion of charged tracers. The publication of these novel scientific insights is currently under preparation [Schiller and Coveney]. This research has benefitted considerably from the generous allocation of computing time on ARCHER through UKCOMES. Dr. Schiller will continue to develop and use LB3D at Clemson University, USA, thus broadening the international scientific impact of LB3D. Furthermore, the LB3D code is one of the application codes in the European H2020 Compat project http://www.compat-project.eu/, where it will be used to enable bleeding edge simulations for computational materials science research on emerging exascale HPC systems.
FabSim has been used in a range of journal publications in bloodflow modelling, clay-polymer modelling, and modelling of protein-ligand binding affinities.

Used as part of the ongoing SICSA Multicore Challenge.
This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques. BBI is interested in a knowledge transfer partnership on this technology.
The technique is being utilized extensively over several research projects, including a collaborative project with Bristol University with interest in correlative light-electron microscopy . It is planned to become part of an imaging facility at Cardiff University.

The website has enabled industry and academics to engage with the outputs of the project.
Prediction and control of behaviour and abnormalities in any complex dynamical network, and in particular in those encountered in biology require the development of multivariate predictive models that integrate large dataset from different sources. Although, a large amount of data are being collected on a daily basis, very few methods allow the automatic creation from these data of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation models for understanding and (re-)design/control, and an inordinate amount of time is still being spent on the manual aggregation of information and expert development of models that explains these data.

In this context, the problem of reconstruction or identification of biological systems from experimental time series data is of fundamental importance. Yet, the development of general reconstruction techniques remains challenging, especially for nonlinear system identification. We are currently developing new methods to identify both parametric structure and parameter values in nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation models from heterogeneous datasets. Applications of such nonlinear systems identification methods cover fundamental questions in systems biology, synthetic biology (debugging and design of cellular systems) and modelling of complex dynamical networks.

As this is a prototype, further impact will be for the future.
STIR is widely used as a research tool with a total of more than 260 citations in journals and conference proceedings. It has been used as the initial reconstruction software for the ClearPET preclinical PET scanner, allowing much faster introduction to the market. The scatter correction component of STIR has been used as tools for evaluation of a 3D method and convinced GE Healthcare to modify their own scatter correction software accordingly.

The current update considerably enhances usability for research purposes. Previous versions of STIR was command-line based.  Cluster-based parallelisation using MPI was already available in STIR. However, many researchers prefer to use interactive languages such that it is easier to try new ideas and get easier feedback via data examination. The multi-threading enhancement speeds-up computation time for interactive use.
This software has only just been released and a publication is currently under review.
This software is being adopted by other academics and some industrial partners are also using it.
Since the launch of the new portal in February 2016, the portal has had around 50,000 hits by 17,847 unique IP addresses indicating that the website has a quite broad reach within the UK bio-simulation community.
