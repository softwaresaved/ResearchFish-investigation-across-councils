KRoC provides a demonstrator providing proof-of-concept technology for performance scalability (w.r.t. the number of cores) of complex concurrent systems (including real-time and complex modelling).  Although occam-pi is (regrettably) not a `mainstream' system language, the mechanisms developed for its implementation -- that provide efficient and multicore scalability -- and for the verification of the concurrent behaviour of its programmed systems provide targets for mainstream technologies to achieve. Published papers (listed as outcomes from our EPSRC `CoSMoS' research grant) explain the mechanisms developed for this.
We have a user base of several thousand, including most of the major photoacoustic imaging groups from around the world. The question-and-answer forum, which we maintain, is constantly active.

ONETEP is continually developed and new, updated versions are released on an annual basis. The developments associated with this grant were released during the period of the grant, between 2009 and 2013. It is one of the leading codes of its kind in the world and unique in being sold commercially: in 2004 it was adopted by Accelrys (now Dassault Systemes), a leading scientific software company, as the flagship for a new international Nanotechnology Consortium of mainly industrial and government partners, leading to its launch as a new product within the Materials Studio suite of software in 2008. An inexpensive academic license is also available worldwide direct from Cambridge Enterprise Ltd. Total revenue from ONETEP to date exceeds Â£2M from over 200 organisations worldwide.

The software enables users to rapidly produce bespoke EoS, tailored to their particular application. It will also enable these models to continually evolve as new measurements become available, ensuring that experimental advances are rapidly converted into improved CCS modelling and, ultimately, better performance and efficiency of real CCS processes. During the project a demonstration workshop was held to train potential industrial and academic users on the use of the software.

Ultimately, the tool will make it straightforward for users to continually and rapidly update their EoS in response to emerging experimental data. The resulting EoS will deliver greater range, certainty and computational efficiency in a wide range of CCS modelling. These EoS will contribute to more effective optimisation of CCS, making the process cleaner, safer, more efficient and more economical. This modelling will also be essential to design codes and safety regulations and will provide key modelling support to the urgently required public engagement and consultation on pipeline transport of CO2.

The software covers two separate models for spatial analysis; the Space Syntax model and the Agent model. These two models are theoretically different in spite of the fact that they agree on the principal relationship between space and society. They start from different representations, and they diverge at the point of modelling. The agent model represents an emergent process that leads to form aggregate patterns of movement activity. Through its ability to display movement data in relation to aggregate patterns of agents, depthmapX's agents have proven to be an effective tool to simulate natural movement. Space Syntax builds on a synchronic reduction of spatial relationships in the built environment. Mapping this reduction into networks of longest and fewest lines, depthmapX's axial and segment analyses are powerful methods for predicting to-movement and through-movement in cities. On the scale of buildings, spatial analysis using depthmapX can reveal relational structures that convey how social organisations occupy spaces. depthmapX is a platform that brings together these too models to be tested in an analytical approach. It also affords experimental and developer approaches.

The current usage of this software has proven to engage different types of academic communities that have a language in common with the notion of space. These communities range between planners, designers, social scientists, anthropologists, crime scientists, geographers, computer scientists and economists. In general terms, all what brings together the social and the spatial. In different contexts, spatial modelling using depthmapX can help forming assumptions about social behaviour in space and model spatial and social relationships. Moreover, depthmapX significance exceeds its common usage as an analytical tool to understand the built environment on different scales and go beyond that to act as a design and decision making support tool. The intelligent usage of software will deploy it in supporting design process with a knowledge-base that is suggested to make designs more responsive towards the real settings of the built environment. In simple terms, depthmapX is increasingly used as a tool for design thinking. By using it efficiently, the software helps on sparing time and cost, particularly on the scale of complex buildings and large scale urban planning.
Currently the "Space Syntax Toolkit" consists of two modules: "Graph analysis" and "Attributes explorer". The "Graph analysis" module supports the verification and analysis of the spatial network model. This consists of an axial map layer, representing the urban street network, and an unlinks layer, indicating bridges and tunnels with no level crossing. The module offers a verification tool to check the geometric and topological integrity of each layer, helping correct any problems before running the analysis. The axial and segment analysis is performed in depthmapXnet, via a direct link from QGIS, which receives and prepares the results once the calculations are completed. The "Attributes explorer" module supports the visual and statistical exploration of the analysis results. It provides quick analysis of individual quantitative attributes of a selected layer, mapping the values using simplified symbology settings, displaying essential descriptive statistics, and plotting basic interactive charts (histogram and scatter plot).

During the research different tools for a number of platforms (Python, C# plugins and R statistical modelling, Rhino/Grasshopper plugins) were developed in order to generate and visualise the results of this new Space Syntax analysis method. The results were published on the Journal of Space Syntax, describing a 3D VGA analysis research based on 'cube-like' encoded space that can be seen as both a small scale building analysis but also an urban scale setting. This theoretical &quot;cube-like&quot; structure is chosen in order to reassemble attributes of real settings.

Xen has thrown open the doors to experimental new operating systems such as ours, and it is fitting that we (as Xen developers too) improve the state of cloud management toolstacks. Many of the Mirage 1.0 libraries (such as the device driver implementations) are being used in XenServer as part of the disaggregation of the monolithic driver domain into multiple, less-privileged &quot;stub domains&quot;. While the low-level plumbing for stub domains has existed for some years, they are difficult to build and debug in practise. Mirage's first major application is to transform the XAPI control stack into a standalone distributed system that can run an entire cluster of hosts with a greater degree of reliability, security and scalability than exists today.

Important benefits of new technology are the cost and its ability to survey a larger proportion of the asset stock in much shorter time than when CCTV is used alone. This technology is not intended to replace CCTV completely, but it enables the operators to reduce the survey costs and increase the efficiency and levels of customer service by focusing CCTV on those pipes where need is greatest and managing interventions through measuring objective change. SewerBattTM can also be used to confirm that interventions such as pipe replacement, rehabilitation or cleaning have been carried out to a satisfactory standard. A report commissioning from an independent consultant found that potential savings in the inspection costs from the application of SewerBattTM technology ranging from 35% to 82% could be achieved. These savings enable more focused CCTV inspection to be carried out on a given length of sewer network or permit surveys of larger pipe lengths a given inspection budget.

This software package is a new release of one of a handful of 'recommended' packages supplied with the base distribution of R. Previous versions have been widely used in a wide range of applications, particularly in ecology and natural resource management, as well as medicine, epidemiology and economics. For example the energy company EDF use the methods for electricity load forecasting. In addition the package is currently used by 102 other software packages for R. For example the underlying fitting methods are sufficiently general that they can be efficiently leveraged for functional data analysis, as in the 'refund' package.
Traditional capture-recapture approaches to estimating animal abundance or density ignore an obvious spatial component of capture probability; organisms close to traps are more likely to be captured than those that are far away. Explicitly accounting for an individual's location provides additional information from which to infer animal density. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have been developed for this purpose. An advantage of these over traditional capture-recapture methodology is that they allow for animal density estimation using passive detectors (e.g., cameras or microphones) over a single sampling occasion.

AD Model Builder (ADMB) is a statisical software package most widely used for nonlinear modelling, and is well suited to the implementation of maximum likelihood SECR methods. Although growing in popularity since becoming freely available, open-source software in 2008, ADMB is used by a minority of statisticians and ecologists, who, in general, are far more comfortable with the popular programming language and software environment R.

The aim of admbsecr is to enable a user is able to fit SECR models that incorporate additional spatial information, using ADMB to fit the model and return the results to the R session.

The application is open-source. NLP on social media data is hard. Content is often brief, contains mistakes, lacks context, and is uncurated - very different from the well-formed news text that tools typically operate over. TwitIE is a GATE pipeline for Information Extraction over tweets, one of the noisiest forms of social media text.
The tagger is available open-source. Part-of-speech tagging tweets is hard. The tagger achieves competitive accuracy, and uses the Penn Treebank tagset, so that all other tools should integrate seamlessly.
The application is open-source. Crowdsourcing is an increasingly popular, collaborative approach for acquiring annotated corpora. Despite this, reuse of corpus conversion tools and user interfaces between projects is still problematic, since these are not generally made available. The GATE Crowdsourcing plugin offers infrastructural support for mapping documents to crowdsourcing units and back, as well as automatically generating reusable crowdsourcing interfaces for NLP classification and sequence annotation tasks.

PyOP2 is primarily used as a component of Firedrake.  Firedrake has a growing community of users, evidenced to some extent by the papers listed at http://firedrakeproject.org/publications.html.  PyOP2 is a separate conceptual abstraction which is potentially usable independently.
OP2 is being adopted by Rolls Royce to support GPU and multicore acceleration of their flagship HYDRA fluid dynamics software.

PyOP2, which is developed from OP2's concepts, is a key abstraction in the Firedrake Project (www.firedrakeproject.org).
The app has been downloaded and played approximately 2000 times (via a combination of Goole Play and Apple app stores)
Papers describing this code, together with applications of it, are currently being written up. The code itself allows for simulations of systems relevant to experiment to be carried out.
Simulations results (using the software code) demonstrate the potential of the developed neuro-biologically inspired autonomous vehicle control methods and models, to simultaneously and more effectively track (in relation to conventional control methods):
(1) desired longitudinal and lateral displacements, 
(2) and vehicle speed changes, 
(3) in addition to achieving the desired speed of response, whilst penalising excessive control actions - with significant potential implications for both fuel and emission economy.
The project software, which has been made publicly available to maximise impact, is serving as a benchmark and an open-source testbed for research and development of both next generation assisted-driving and safety warning systems, as well as future safe, efficient and smart autonomous vehicle models requiring integrative multi-modal cognitive control technology. In addition, the simulation and cognitive control of realistic, validated car-like rover models (implemented in the project software) are serving as benchmarks models for research and development of next generation, low-cost, autonomous rover vehicle control systems for planetary missions.
Used at many research centres, including NASA Langley.

First sparse direct solver to work on GPUs
The analysis of images captured through standard and high-speed digital video microscopy enabled the determination of i) distributions of droplet diameters ii) distributions of levels of droplet deformation iii) droplet generation frequencies iv) droplet speeds.
The two-phase flow dynamics and the droplet break-up process were simulated by solving the Stokes equations (Momentum and mass conservation) and the Level set equation through the Comsol microfluidics module. The outcome of the numerical simulations in terms of droplet size and generation frequency were qualitatively in good agreement with the experimental results.
The heat equation was solved for heptane droplets both spherical and deformed, heated by Gaussian laser beams and immersed in either water or deuterium oxide bulk phases. The model inputs were i) the laser beam intensity profile -  obtained from numerical solutions of the Maxwell equations (in the modelling and control work stream) and ii) the deformed droplet shapes - experimentally obtained through structured illumination measurements (in the optics work stream). The model outputs were the temperature and the interfacial tension profiles at the droplet interfaces.

The declarative style of the YAML metadata used to configure the library provides a simplified means for developers and end-user scientists and researchers to specify their jobs and switch much more easily between cluster and cloud platforms. For example, where users wish to undertake some jobs on a local cluster platform and take advantage of cloud infrastructure for other aspects of their workload, the libhpc deployer provides support for straightforwardly selecting a different target platform on a per-job basis.
The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;. The library offers a demonstration of the differences and power of coordination forms when compared to existing workflow languages or systems. The ability to handle multiple implementations of software components and the orchestration processes used to control them is of particular use in modern heterogeneous computing environments.
This software makes possible use of forward flux sampling by a wider scientific community.

This version of the code was used to run some of the simulations in &quot;Computational Assay of H7N9 Influenza Neuraminidase Reveals R292K
Mutation Reduces Drug Binding Affinity&quot; Scientific Reports, doi:10.1038/srep03561 The emergence of a novel H7N9 avian influenza that infects humans is a serious cause for concern. Of the genome sequences of H7N9 neuraminidase available, one contains a substitution of arginine to lysine at position 292, suggesting a potential for reduced drug binding efficacy. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir bound to H7N9, H7N9-R292K, and a structurally related H11N9 neuraminidase. They show that H7N9 neuraminidase is structurally homologous to H11N9, binding the drugs in identical modes. The simulations reveal that the R292K mutation disrupts drug binding in H7N9 in a comparable manner to that observed experimentally for H11N9-R292K. Absolute binding free energy calculations with the WaterSwap method confirm a reduction in binding affinity. This indicates that the efficacy of antiviral drugs against H7N9-R292K will be reduced. Simulations can assist in predicting disruption of binding caused by mutations in neuraminidase, thereby providing a computational 'assay.'

HTK 3.5 has been used as a platform to develop various types of speech technology research at Cambridge, building on developments over many years to focus on the use of deep neural network acoustic models and recurrent neural network language models.

A particular outcome has been the development of the Cambridge University systems for the 2015 ARSU multi-genre broadcast (MGB) challenge. This required the processing of more than 1600 hours of BBC TV audio data and developing systems for transcription, subtitle alignment and diarisation. This was embodied in 4 tasks in the MGB challenge, and Cambridge University systems based on HTK 3.5 had the best performance for all these tasks.

Many HTK users have downloaded HTK 3.5 and are actively using it to develop both research and commercial systems.
This software was used to train RNNLMs that were used in the Cambridge University transcription systems used in the 2015 ASRU multi-genre broadcast challenge (international challenge involving the automatic transcription of BBC broadcast audio). The Cambridge system gave the lowest error rates in the challenge and the use of RNNLMs efficiently trained on a large corpus of subtitle material was a key component, as well as the use of topic adaptation.

Allows to model high-frequency MHD modes seen by MAST at CCFE, first publication by Sharapov et al. (2015).
The code is now being used to provide detailed on flow and heat transfer in compression/expansion spaces in the presence of net flow through these spaces and (importantly) behind meshes/orifices which more realistically represent the flow that would be expected in high-performance such systems. These data will be soon provided to other groups (e.g. Denmark Technical University, University of Twente) who require this for advanced model and practical system development (e.g. by Isentropic Ltd.)
The codes are being used to provide thermal and pressure (where relevant) loss variations with important design (e.g. geometry of the compression/expansion space) and operation (frequency, valve timings). These will form the basis of a closer interaction with the Universities of Ghent and Liege. Ultimately, an attempt will be made to incorporate these into libraries for the modelling of reciprocating machines, but also for suggesting next-generation high-performance compression/expansion machines.

Building on the implementation it is much easier to formalise and implement other auction schemas.
Anecdotally, the wiki has become widely used in the CRNT community. This was visible recently at a CRNT workshop in Portsmouth, where we found that a variety of academics from the UK, Europe and North America all regularly use it as a reference tool when writing papers in this area. One expected long term result is a harmonisation of language and basic assumptions across CRNT research communities with somewhat different frameworks and histories, allowing greater scope for collaboration and communication between these communities.
The tool, which is under continuous development, has become quite widely used within the chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) community. Development has also been opened up to the wider community and modules have subsequently been added by researchers not originally part of the development team. The goal is both to allow new results which naturally take algorithmic forms to be made widely available, and to provide an open source alternative to some of the closed source CRN analysis software currently available. We expect long term impact to be significant.

This software is key to the operation of the iPerfusion system. This system led to several collaborative projects.
Used for teaching NMR simulations at graduate level (CDT).
Testing and revising a number of prototypes also gave insights related to design issues. Each prototype had different benefits for difference group of users and it could not be said that one is better than the other.  We are also not advocating replacing physical activities with only virtual activities.  Instead, we believe that VW can provide interactive experiences to promote a continuing selfhood which may have been lost due to dementia and/or moving to long-term care facilities. It can also provide stimulation and engagement to promote a feel good factor. Negative memories could be mitigated by playful design. VW could also be a "place" that allows staff and residents to foster personal relationship and trust, which may improve care.
The program is used in the academic community of researchers in physics, applied mathematics and life sciences, investigating effects of delay.
The software is still under development, but we have received a request for additional knot theoretic features as an aid as a research exploration tool.

An outstanding feature of our approach is that the control techniques we are developing are solely based on input-output data readouts from the network, with the goal to provide optimal and robust operation of potentially poorly characterised or unknown networks. We call such an approach data-based optimal control as opposed to more classical model-based approaches. Data-based methods aim to infer/learn a feedback optimal control law from input-output data collected from the system, i.e., from the way the output of the system reacts to various perturbations at the input of the system.
Prediction and control of behaviour and abnormalities in any complex dynamical network, and in particular in those encountered in biology require the development of multivariate predictive models that integrate large dataset from different sources. Although, a large amount of data are being collected on a daily basis, very few methods allow the automatic creation from these data of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation models for understanding and (re-)design/control, and an inordinate amount of time is still being spent on the manual aggregation of information and expert development of models that explains these data.

In this context, the problem of reconstruction or identification of biological systems from experimental time series data is of fundamental importance. Yet, the development of general reconstruction techniques remains challenging, especially for nonlinear system identification. We are currently developing new methods to identify both parametric structure and parameter values in nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation models from heterogeneous datasets. Applications of such nonlinear systems identification methods cover fundamental questions in systems biology, synthetic biology (debugging and design of cellular systems) and modelling of complex dynamical networks.

Initial studies in November 2013, using scans of fragments of a synthetic fresco, have shown that the user feedback collected that way is effective and helps increasing the quality of our match suggestions to conservators who reassemble a shattered wallpainting. The next step of evaluation, required to finalise the app, will be to run the system alongside the assembly of a Late-Bronze-Age fresco that has not been assembled previously. However, due to local constraints on site, it was not possible to conduct this experiment with our partners at the Akrotiri excavation. We still plan to run the fully-fledged study as soon as the situation on site has changed (hopefully in summer 2015), which will aim at including the regular visitors to the Akrotiri excavation as test subjects, too. Ultimately, we believe that the software will be able to assist various assembly projects in cultural heritage applications, and that its development will spawn additional, similar projects.
ONETEP is continually developed and new, updated versions are released on an annual basis. The developments associated with this grant were released during the period of the grant, between 2009 and 2013. It is one of the leading codes of its kind in the world and unique in being sold commercially: in 2004 it was adopted by Accelrys (now Dassault SystÃ¨mes BIOVIA), a leading scientific software company, as the flagship for a new international Nanotechnology Consortium of mainly industrial and government partners, leading to its launch as a new product within the Materials Studio suite of software in 2008. An inexpensive academic license is also available worldwide direct from Cambridge Enterprise Ltd. Total revenue from ONETEP to date exceeds $4.5M from over 200 organisations worldwide.
The availability and maturity of this software has been a significant factor in many established and new collaborative partnerships.
The software has been adopted by several research teams around the world for this data analysis, and several publications have appeared using data treated by this program.

The system provides 3 key elements:
1) A timeline which provides instinctive chronological flexibility consisting of multiple arrays of time-scales - days, hours and minutes. The user can expand or contract the timeline allowing the user to manipulate the volume of displayed documents. 
2) A zooming functionality, created by fixing a camera to the 2D x-plane in the 3D environment, facilitates user controlled data convergence. This allows users to zoom in and out of the Z-axis which changes the distance of the camera plane in relation to the displayed objects. The user can control the amount of documents currently on display by the system. Furthermore, it allows the user to focus on clusters of documents that may be of particular interest.
3) The visualisation of information through inter-document relationships. The system database contains a vast range of data which is used by the system to create arrays of objects which have underlying connections. These relationships are used to generate the default GUI.  The goal of exploiting the underlying relationships is to allow the user to quickly retrieve information based on whatever knowledge they have relating to the search.

This proposed work is extremely relevant to this call under the Digital Economy theme. Food is of
key importance in a sustainable society. Plant diseases are a major foe to global food security,
which have the potential to significantly decrease crop yields and increase postharvest losses,
especially in the face of climate change. Disease prevention and management are essential for the
sustainability of our society. This project aims to develop a software tool to effectively detect crop
diseases, reduce yield losses, improve food security and therefore achieve sustainability.

This software package is one of a handful of 'recommended' packages supplied with the base distribution of R. Previous versions have been widely used in a wide range of applications, particularly in ecology and natural resource management, as well as medicine, epidemiology and economics. For example the energy company EDF use the methods for electricity load forecasting. In addition the package is currently used by 102 other software packages for R. For example the underlying fitting methods are sufficiently general that they can be efficiently leveraged for functional data analysis, as in the 'refund' package.
Used for energy load prediction problems by EDF (France). Collaboration with EDF to improve methods for this purpose.
The STIR software package has a relatively large user base; the additions are mainly of interest to the small but expanding community who have PET/MR and who wish to experiment with alternative reconstruction algorithms.

Bela has gained significant traction amongst researchers, musicians and hobbyists in the 2014-16 period. 

On 29 February 2016, we launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Bela, seeking Â£5k to build and distribute the hardware. We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign) and as of one week later, we have raised more than Â£31k with over three weeks remaining. So far there are 320 backers of the campaign, and we have received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands) and industry (ROLI, who are interested in supporting their JUCE environment).

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL). At this point (excluding the Kickstarter campaign) roughly 30 people in Europe and North America (majority researchers, some industry members, some musicians) have bought Bela hardware from us.
From a commercial perspective, the app provides a slick demonstrator for potential investors without the overhead of digging deep into mobile platforms. The app was presented during Queen Mary University of London's School of Elec. Eng. and Computer Sc. Research Showcase (3 April 2014) which attracted a lot of visitors including many industrials. The app raised the interest of our partners Omniphone and Abbey Road Studios we collaborate with on research projects. We demonstrated the app to Rocket Music, a company founded by Elton John, and are currently in discussion with them to create a new digital music product.
From a pedagogical perspective, the SoundBite app represents a useful way to introduce UG and PG students to some of the Music Information Retrieval technologies developed by Queen Mary University of London.

SHARE-IT achieved a quality of implementation that makes it fit for use as the basis for a number of different applications.  It is currently trialed in India as part of a project aimed to ascertain its cross-cultural viability as well as the computer platform for a neuroscientific intervention aimed to support primary school children in learning counterintuitive concepts in mathematics and science.
The notable impacts resulting from the application of the software is the generation of real-world applicable decision support outputs which directly inform the current draft planning documents for a number of Western Australian recovery catchments.
The use of this app in a rural rather than urban environment further allowed the research team to investigate its benefits and limitations, while also introducing the technology to a new audience.
The final version of the app allowed for continuity to be examined between users of Greendoors 2013 and Greendoors 2014, e.g. did familiarity with the app encourage a larger number of downloads or more indepth use?
This version of the app was greatly improved from the first iteration, and the creation of live reports allowed users to get the information they requested in a more timely fashion.
Users of the Greendoors app were able to access additional information about retrofitting measures, thereby making the research process much easier.

Tools for experimental optimisation by analysis of preliminary structure results are included in the CRYSTALS software package. We are currently writing up the theory and applied examples with recommendations to allow other groups to follow the methods.
Existing software tools for designing crystallographic experiments are often closed-source and are limited to standard experiments. Scientists are left with great challenges to exploit new instrument technology for non-standard data collections like photoÂ­crystallography. The tools presented here have been used to create experiment strategies in-house and at Diamond Light Source, by Oxford researchers and by beamline staff. The software has also been used to support developments of a time-resolved crystallography instrument at University of Nancy.
There has been increased engagement on social media (Blue-Green Cities twitter feed and LinkedIn Group) since the Blue-Green Cities website was released. The website also provides an outlet for BGC outputs (conference and journal papers) to be downloaded, thus enabling the research findings to be disseminated to a wider community. Requests for information on the project have also directly come through the website.
Speed and accuracy of parameter extraction allowing analysis of results to be done post collection.  The software was then used to update software to provide more accurate real-time feedback.
Gives coaches and athletes a more robust tool for monitoring their performance in real time, as well as having the functionality to look back on previous efforts.
Ability to monitor and store results from elite athletes using the system to monitor their performance and provide coaches with information to assist them make training program decisions.
The web interface provides correctly scaled visualisation of the data in real-time, offering the ability to monitor energy consumption as the machine is running.
Information that would only be available on an instantaneous basis is securely and reliably forwarded, stored and accessed.  Parameters, such as communications rate, current and voltage gain and current wiring configuration, that could only be changed by modification of energy monitor firmware and re-installation of these devices can now be performed remotely while machines are running.
Enables data which could ordinarily only be locally and instantaneously monitored on an LCD display to be transmitted over the Internet for real-time processing by analytical services and real-time monitoring via web interfaces.  Supports remote reconfiguration of device firmware parameters, which otherwise could only be modified by firmware update, entailing physical access to the energy monitor.

Reduced infrastructure impact and cost of equipment through the use of sensor nodes to range and trilaterate location, in comparison to approaches using RFID tags (distributed tags and readers robustly supported and maintained throughout the environment); WiFi and Ultra Wide Band (requires complex and costly infrastructure of cables and nodes).
Without this software the capturing of RFID performance data from RFID readers was slow and cumbersome. RangeFinder has allowed experiments to be carried out at a much faster pace and with a unified interface.
The EIIS Track portal is key for the dissemination of data collected by RFID portals located on the shopfloor.
It's filtering services have the ability to determine the state of the shopfloor based upon current and previous portal data entry.
By developing a PLC based API, RFID readers can be integrated with existing machines and manufacturing systems that utilise Siemens PLCs for control. Thus, reducing the impact for IT infrastructure and cost of implementing RFID technology within manufacturing.
To date, the developed software has only been evaluated with a small user group of parents. They have used the prototype to maintain a digital record of daily behaviours, exhibited by one or more of their children. 

Qualitative feedback (please see key findings description section) supports envisaged benefits of use of this tool as an interactive assistive technology for streamlining and augmenting data collection procedures within the home environment and / or other pertinent environment, such as the classroom. 

Initial findings from this research have been reported at the 12th International Conference On Smart home and health Telematics (ICOST), held in Denver, USA. Please refer to the Engagement Activities section for further information.
The developed web tool automates many of the manual processes currently employed by parents and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) within a home-based autism intervention setting. Specifically, the tool provides instant visualisation of recorded data through the provision of a user driven user interface that aggregates, summarises and showcases clinically important patterns in behaviour. These visualisation services alone offer significant potential for increasing BA's ability to discover behaviour patterns and to subsequently introduce more timely home-based intervention treatments. 

The visualisation service is further supported via a data mining service that highlights (based on the application of association rule modelling) the 'predicted' causes and effects of particular behaviour by mining previously recorded data from one or more individuals with autism. The service, while requiring further validation through longer user evaluations to generate more data, has the potential to reduce the workload of BAs by supporting them with functional analysis of a child's behaviour.
Based on the feedback from 20 participants (4 parents (Phase one), 8 child-parent groupings (Phase two)), the findings positively support the potential utility of LifePal, however, highlight the importance of delivering sufficient user training to support adoption and the need for longitudinal evaluations.

Among the most highly rated features were both life-logging and the rewards service which included the facility to generate a personalised contract between the parent and child. Another interesting observation was that younger users found the App easy to use while parents reported a learning curve associated with the web portal. In terms of qualitative feedback, parents praised the concepts of the platform, high-lighting the advantages of delivering services via technology in comparison with paper-based approaches. They also indicated that LifePal added structure to their child's day, allowing them to know what lay ahead and provided them with a safe space to life-log in a non-verbal way. 
The public release was within the past 6 months, so impact is only starting to feed through.  I have been contacted by academics using the software to explore homomorphic encryption for the first time, becoming interested in the potential for its use in statistics and machine learning.  A startup company, Numerai, have also been in contact and are exploring its use in sharing sensitive data to designers of proprietary algorithms, where both parties require privacy.

The CoCoA [NIPS 2014] / CoCoA+ [ICML 2015] distributed optimization algorithm developed in a duo of papers with two co-authors from Edinburgh (Martin TakÃ¡Ä, myself) has won the MLconf Industry Impact Student Research Award. The award goes to our coauthor Virginia Smith (UC Berkeley). Other co-authors: M. Jaggi (ETH Zurich), M.I. Jordan (Berkeley), C. Ma (Lehigh), J. Terhorst (UC Berkeley), S. Krishnan (UC Berkeley), T. Hofmann (ETH Zurich).

About the award: &quot;This year, we started a new award program called the MLconf Industry Impact Student Research Award, which is sponsored by Google. This fall, our committee of distinguished ML professionals reviewed several nominations sent in from members of the MLconf community. There were several great researchers that were nominated and the committee arrived at awarding 2 students whose work, they believe, has the potential to disrupt the industry in the future. The two winners that were announced at MLconf SF 2015 are UC Irvine Student, Furong Huang and UC Berkeley Student, Virginia Smith. Below are summaries of their research. We've invited both researchers to present their work at upcoming MLconf events.&quot;

The citation: &quot; Virginia Smith's research focuses on distributed optimization for large-scale machine learning. The main challenge in many large-scale machine learning tasks is to solve an optimization objective involving data that is distributed across multiple machines. In this setting, optimization methods that work well on single machines must be re-designed to leverage parallel computation while reducing communication costs. This requires developing new distributed optimization methods with both competitive practical performance and strong theoretical convergence guarantees. Virginia's work aims to determine policies for distributed computation that meet these requirements, in particular through the development of a novel primal-dual framework, CoCoA, which is written on Spark. The theoretical and practical development of CoCoA is an important step for future data scientists hoping to deploy efficient large-scale machine learning algorithms.&quot;

Range of geometries on which the library's Nedelec implementation if valid has been vastly improved. Previously only rectangular-faced geometries were possible.
A journal article has been submitted to Computers and Structures and is under review.
The code has been provided to our collaborators in Cardiff University who intend to develop a parallel version of the software.
This addition to deal.II allows for the solution of electromagnetic problems using Nedelec on meshes that do not conform to its standard convention. This includes meshes generated externally using external mesh generators as well as certain classes of geometries (e.g. spheres) built by within the deal.II library. As written above, the implemented basis function set also lends itself to efficient preconditioners for problems in electromagnetism, including eddy current problems.
This demo has just been released this year. The source code is available at the demonstration web site.

This new model has enabled us to investigate the effects of the growth of 3D asymmetries on the performance of inertial confinement fusion capsules on the National Ignition Facility, including the effects of asymmetry in the driving radiation source and defects in capsule manufacture.
This software has enabled accurate calculations of radiation cooling rates in large scale radiation hydrodynamics and MHD simulations of high energy density plasmas. It also enables the generation of synthetic experimental X-ray spectra to be generated in post-processing calculations as well as the generation of detailed opacity tables for use in radiation transport models.

New functionality added and the website improved.
While it is too early to gather precise impact data we are pleased that the main paper describing the BEM++ library, which has appeared in Transactions on Mathematical Software in 2015, has been cited 40 times (Google Scholar citations) in its first year, which is a very high number for Mathematics. Also, we regularly observe now other groups at conferences presenting results based on BEM++. As time progresses the citation count of the main BEM++ paper will be some measure on how widely the software continues to be used.

TemPSS makes use of the concepts of software parameter templates and application profiles. Templates represent the parameter decision space of an application while profiles provide instantiations of a template with parameters specific to a particular job or task to be accomplished with the target application. Significantly, TemPSS allows the creation of partial profiles - incomplete sets of parameters - and supports collaboration between different entities who can each partially instantiate a profile with the parameters that they understand how to specify optimally. An end-user can then be presented with an almost complete profile that they can finalise to run the target application.

Since the release of the first version of Longbow, there have been just over 400 verified unique downloads between the HECBioSim download repository and the Python PyPi index. The active user-base includes users from both academic (21 different institutions in the UK) and the industrial sector globally.

Longbow has also been or is currently being incorporated into software pipelines of other groups/consortia, projects of notable progress include integrating with FLEX-EM a powerful tool developed by CCP-EM and FESetup developed by CCPBioSim. The Longbow project led to a collaboration with pharmaceutical company UCB into integration of Longbow into their workflow, this also led to a feasibility study into the construction of a similar tool for commercial cloud services such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure.
This tool has proved to be quite popular amongst the academic community, feedback from members of the community has been very positive for this tool with requests to expand to more codes being quite common. The tool has helped groups that do not have a traditional background in HPC to make sense of the often quite daunting application process for super computing time. Usage statistics from this tool suggest it has been utilised by 1,343 unique IP addresses globally and that users are likely to be making use of this tool for systems that are very similar to ARCHER.

The HECBioSim portal has been heavily utilised by a very broad spectrum of users. Since the website was installed in 2014 we have had just over 213,000 hits by 67,869 unique IP addresses. Users are making heavy use of the ARCHER application form, guidance material and the kAU calculator tool, suggesting that users are finding these tools helpful over the old word document by email application process. Other sections of the website seeing heavy use are the software download and the documentation repositories.
This open source code has only just been released - thus impact is not known at this stage.
LB3D has been used to study self-assembly of cubic phases, micro-mixing, flow through porous media, fluid surface interactions and other problems in complex fluidics. In addition, we have implemented the moment propagation method in LB3D, which allows us to efficiently measure the effective diffusion, dispersion, and other transport properties of ionic species in electrokinetic flows. These developments have enabled us to reveal interesting phenomena in charged rocks, namely a non-monotonic dispersion coefficient and a crossover in the effective diffusion of charged tracers. The publication of these novel scientific insights is currently under preparation [Schiller and Coveney]. This research has benefitted considerably from the generous allocation of computing time on ARCHER through UKCOMES. Dr. Schiller will continue to develop and use LB3D at Clemson University, USA, thus broadening the international scientific impact of LB3D. Furthermore, the LB3D code is one of the application codes in the European H2020 Compat project http://www.compat-project.eu/, where it will be used to enable bleeding edge simulations for computational materials science research on emerging exascale HPC systems.
FabSim has been used in a range of journal publications in bloodflow modelling, clay-polymer modelling, and modelling of protein-ligand binding affinities.
DL_MESO is UKCOMES's flagship open-source software for worldwide distribution: a general purpose, highly scalable mesoscale simulation package for both Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) methods [1]. It is written in C++ for LBM and Fortran90 for DPD. It is supplied with its own Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is capable of both serial and parallel execution using MPI and/or OpenMP. 

DL_MESO was initially developed for the UK's collaborative computational project for simulation of condensed phases (CCP5) during 2003-06. It was subsequently made available to the global community through open access. In a rapidly developing field like mesoscale modelling, the relevance and importance of DL_MESO depend on its continued upgrading in modelling capabilities and computational efficiency on new computing architectures. UKCOMES activities contribute to DL_MESO in three main aspects: (1) incorporation of the latest physical models; (2) assessment and validation of physical models and numerical methods in DL_MESO; (3) adaptation to new software and hardware environments. Briefly, work by UKCOMES is to ensure the accuracy, robustness and reliability of DL_MESO so that it stays at the cutting edge of mesoscale simulation. 

DL_MESO has a global user base. More than 1,100 academic licences for DL_MESO have been granted since its first release in 2004. The current version of DL_MESO (2.6) was released in November 2015 and has 59 users to date. The previous release (version 2.5) had 410 registered users from academia and industry: among them, about 20% were based in the UK, 24% mainland Europe, 19% China, 10% North America and 27% in the rest of the world. Dividing these users among their subject groups, 37% are identified as engineers, 21% physicists, 20% chemists, 12% material scientists and smaller numbers of computer scientists, earth scientists, bioscientists and mathematicians. Examples of applications include catalytic reactive flows [2], water diffusion in proton exchange membrane fuel cells [3] and proton dissociation and transfer using DPD [4].

DL_MESO is being used extensively in a TSB-funded industrial consortium (Unilever, Syngenta, Infineum and STFC's Hartree Centre) for Computer Aided Formulation of new products, using DPD as a heuristic tool for mesoscopic phase prediction to select potential product formulations for laboratory experimentation. 

Current work includes incorporation of various new physical models such as cascaded LBM for multiphase flow [5], a new approach to contact angle hysteresis [6] and kinetic and slip boundary conditions. Co-development with the consortium's other two open-source codes - LB3D and HemeLB - is being considered. Finally, incorporation of GPU and other computing techniques is being explored for new computing architectures, such as Intel Xeon Phi many-core accelerators [7].

The primary use of this controller will be in implementing time-slot allocations to high power demand loads on power-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from hydro-electric generators.  This technique reduces the chance of overloading the system at peak demand periods by activating power supply circuits to high-power load at  pre-allocated time-slots during off-peak periods.  This allows more customers to be served at lower cost to them, while increasing reliability of the mini-grid and improving the operator's Return on Investment (ROI) by keeping the system running closer to full capacity.  It can also be applied to energy-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from wind or solar generators.  In this situation, the time-slots are sold at preferential rates during periods of high solar (or wind) input.  This reduces reliance on batteries, allowing smaller (and cheaper) battery banks, which are put under much less stress so that they last longer.  Thus blackouts and battery damage are reduced as are lifetime costs and therefore customer tariffs.

LIQUID Dataplex is a fundamental tool for the LIQUID project. In particular, we have run experiments (which we will continue to run after the end of the grant duration, as a continuation of the research) on processing keyword searches on the Deep Web, and on the use of integrity constraints for reducing the query processing time.
The adoption of RFT should reduce market inefficiency, lower end-prices and increase producers' income. We are currently setting up a trial study in Talcahuano, Chile, in collaboration with the Universidad del Desarrollo (Santiago and Concepcion, Chile). At the moment the trial study is still being set up, therefore we are currently unable to report on any proper impact.

We are engaged in a number of conversation with industrial partners (e.g., McAfee Labs, Qualcomm, and Google) and academia (e.g., University of Luxembourg, National University Singapore, TU Munich) to further monetize on the capability analysis of CopperDroid.
As this product has only be released recently, there is no impact yet. However, using this software we have been able to detect what we think is the first example of collusion in the wild.
the platform has currently been under a trial by about 200 participants European-wide. Moorfields Eye Hospital is currently recruiting 50 participants in either a single visit or number of visits over the course of up to 3 month. This will allow us to assess the transformational impact of the advanced technologies in real world terms.
- has been used by 20 members of the public at an event at the Writers Studio Nottingham 
- will be used by members of the public during the planned long-term public deployment of the large scale interactive illustrations that have been created in the project 
- enables us to explore the research question of how we can enable interaction with large physical surfaces through embedding multiple visual codes
The Artcodes app has been used in a number of workshops with external users (architects, local councils and museums) to teach them to create artcodes and associated experiences themselves. 

The app has already been used independently by artists to create public experiences. Most notably by Simeon Featherstone  to create the Hidden Language Hidden Trails artwork in Dorchester and by Alice Angus in artwork inspired by the Lymington Saltmarshes.
It underpins the Artcodes and Storicodes mobile apps.
The open source release of the library enables other developers to create bespoke apps that make use of Artcodes.
The library is currently being used by undergraduate and PhD projects.
normal citizens and patients with long term conditions will use the platform for self-management of their diseases.
Used extensively by the collaborators of the Verifiable Autonomy project to design and develop both low level (continuous) vehicle control and high level (discrete, agent based) decision making. Allows for rapid prototyping of systems in a high fidelity environment.
Also used by a number of other institutions outside of the collaboration, repository has been forked 4 times by other projects.
None to this date; it does however act as stepping stone for further research in my research group. The software tutorial is publicly available.

The Menpo project has been used to develop the annotations of the very popular 300VW and 300W (second version) benchmarks. 300VW is the first benchmark for facial landmark tracking methodologies and 300W is the most popular database  for facial landmark localisation in arbitrary conditions (used by the majority of the state-of-the-art published in top computer vision venues, such as ICCV, CVPR, ECCV etc.). The menpo project has been demoed in ICCV 2015. Currently the menpo project has hundredths of users both in academia and industry.
None yet; work in progress
This has been one of the first tools of this kind - we have received positive feedback our industrial partners, who are very likely to seek adoption upon the completion of this project.

This DfMA Decision Making Tool evaluates the impact of consequential decisions from the manufacturing up to assembly in a multi-objective DfMA project. In DfMA projects, the main objectives are to minimize makespan and cost while maximizing safety, which is included in this tool. Safety is maximized by minimizing the number of on-site workers on congested construction sites. Using the multi-objective GA-based optimization model implemented in this tool, optimal solutions for different levels of prefabrication can be determined and compared with respect to overall time and cost.
Applications in safety cases for reactors
The completed numerical model for the simulation of the forming of sheet metals with multi-punches tools, including the tools with cushions, enables prediction of the forming limits and sprinbacks of sheet-metals, which would help to improve the design and manufacturing efficiency.
Can theoretically replace current turbine models used in commercial engine design software, which currently require map data files to predict performance.
The website has enabled industry and academics to engage with the outputs of the project.
The software tool with the CAE Building Blocks methodology have already been used on a number of projects and tasks, including drafting of guidance for the IAEA on the assessment of dependability of nuclear I&amp;C systems important for safety, drafting of templates for arguing about statistical testing as part of the EU Harmonics project, developing cases to address probabilistic modelling of critical infrastructure and particular how one addresses model doubt. We have also used the CAE Blocks plugin on a professional Masters level course at City University London on Information Security and Risk in an Assurance Case module.

The FFEA software is still kept in a private repository. However, we have been collaborating with Toni Collis at the EPCC in different computational approaches, from visualisation of trajectories to performance characterisation and a distributed parallel implementation. 

We plan to release a first version of the software very soon under an Open Source license, together with a technical paper to present the software to the scientific community. We have contacted a number of candidates from Leeds to Canada and Japan that are willing to try the FFEA on their systems. 

The URL below will not work, as the repository is still kept private. However, I could grant access to the EPSRC if they want to visit it.
The software has been released under GPL on the machine learning open source software forum (mloss.org).
The tool has been used for the empirical evaluation of our method for minimising ontologies.

The ability to model the capsule implosion experiments driven by laser or X-ray radiation ablation. The accurate treatment of the pressure and specific heat capacity of materials in the solid phase are essential in order to accurately reproduce the behavior of shock compression of materials during the early phases of compression. This process is important for maintaining a low temperature adiabat during spherical compression in inertial confinement fusion.
A user base has been started, which is expected to grow as the code develops
We will adapt the OpenProof educational system for heterogeneous logic to allow the use of Readith when teaching logic. OpenProof has a worldwide user base, and this will enable us to reach those users, enhancing the educational environment of students and teachers.
The SO3 code is generally applicable whenever Fourier transforms must be computed on SO(3) and will be integral component of new fast wavelet transforms on the sphere.
The FLAGLET code is generally applicable for performing a wavelet analysis of signals defined on the 3D ball.  It will be an integral component of the new 3D weak lensing framework that we are developing.
The tool has been made available for research, and has been licensed to over 40 groups so far.
This has led to about 10 different collaborations with research groups across the world.

When applied to the problem of locating landmarks used by orthodontists on cephelograms (radiographs of the skull), it won an international competition for accuracy.  This has led to discussions with various companies about licensing the technology for inclusion in dental software suites.
The work has resulted in consistent predictions of near field jet dynamics and turbulence statistics from all three different codes. This indicates the fact that the physical model we use in this project is independent of the choice of a numerical solver.

A summary of the work has recently been submitted to the 11th International ERCOFTAC Symposium on Engineering Turbulence Modelling and Measurements (awaiting acceptance).
This software is used for modelling of care pathways by our researchers. We have already modelled part of COPD and Osteoarthritis. We will use the software to evaluate out methods.
Demonstration at SemDial 2015 conference.
This software is now being used in  several projects in our lab. It lead to our NIPS 2015 paper and it  was demonstrated at the IWSDS 2016 conference.
The first auto-tuning tool for HSA programs.
This has enabled object tracking information to be used for behavioural modelling, which has thus far been applied to determining the location of attention of people watching television with a mobile device (see http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2851581.2892483).

Modifications have also been merged into the original CppMT tool by the original author, and are available as open source software for use and reuse by other researchers.
This software enables users to review the outputs of the object tracking of the CppMT tool by eye, to determine its accuracy. It has been used to validate the results of behavioural coding using CppMT (IDInteraction Version) by eye (see http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2851581.2892483), as a precursor to quantitative analysis.
No notable impact.
This software has been created based on discussions within the research community, bringing together experts from many universities and institutions. This process has engaged researchers in our network, but also has made many to think for the first time on how to design software that will be used by many and will be co-developed by a team.
 
As this is a prototype, further impact will be for the future.
STIR is widely used as a research tool with a total of more than 260 citations in journals and conference proceedings. It has been used as the initial reconstruction software for the ClearPET preclinical PET scanner, allowing much faster introduction to the market. The scatter correction component of STIR has been used as tools for evaluation of a 3D method and convinced GE Healthcare to modify their own scatter correction software accordingly.

The current update considerably enhances usability for research purposes. Previous versions of STIR was command-line based.  Cluster-based parallelisation using MPI was already available in STIR. However, many researchers prefer to use interactive languages such that it is easier to try new ideas and get easier feedback via data examination. The multi-threading enhancement speeds-up computation time for interactive use.
This software has only just been released and a publication is currently under review.
Since the launch of the new portal in February 2016, the portal has had around 50,000 hits by 17,847 unique IP addresses indicating that the website has a quite broad reach within the UK bio-simulation community.

This mesh geometry control is fundamental for the study of complex systems, and may be applied in different contexts than the exhaust system used to define it. This technique can also be used on a range of different &quot;systems&quot;, for example it can also be used for automatically defining human anthropometry on complex human computer models, in a different branch of research a Coventry University.
This software can in a few minutes gauge the manufacturing process of any bend tube structure, even in the case of multiple bends.  It is a very useful tool for industrial applications.  Also it is marketable as tables of possible bends and pipe thickness can be computed as a feasibility table as function of the bending process.
