# Discussion with Ben Ryan about changes to first draft

I completed the first draft of the article about the ResearchFish data and sent it to Louise on 8 December 2016. Louise passed it 


How many outcomes in total, i.e. across all outputs in the period 2012 to 2016?
- see research outputs 2016 report
- publications dwarf other output because a lot are taken directly from publications because they cite the grant number and the researcher only needs to confirm it’s correct


Name him?
- Yes

Licence?
- All data is under GtR licence
- All publicly available and 




Email him to get them to read the EPSRC advice and register their software and read the new guidance



Want a “Let us know” call at the start: tell us what you’re doing with your research that we need ResearchFish data to lead the work that’s being done in research.


Remove wrong data types


OS question only relates to Software because that’s the only place where it is asked


Need to look for duplicates by looking for match Tech Product and Impact field and remove the duplciates



Get top five or six licences for the question



Need to work on the year range - try and get years from him



Add a bit to say that the data started being collecting in 2014, data from this year and previous are likely to be retrofitted. Only one data collection in 2016 so far, which is why - from feb to mar in 2016 is when it was 


change “register” to “record” so that people don’t think that EPSRC is endorsing this 





1. Add Open Source question to any product that is software (rather than just “software”)
1. More specific open source questions
1. Do we change thing in the tech product list - other categories - rather than having the number of software 
1. Which domain is this software serving? Maybe a tier-2 JACS code?
