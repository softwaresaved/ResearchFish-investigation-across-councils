Here's a list of the things I'm interested in looking at. If you would like to do some analysis of this data, please let me (Simon) know.

1. Rate at which outputs are being relased over the years (bar chart). Are software outputs becoming more popular?
2. Open/closed/none licences (Pie or stacked bar). Are people licensing their software? Is it changing over the years?
3. Which uni releases the most outputs? If anyone's doing well, why?
4. Popularity of repos (line chart showing increase over time). Who's most popular, and is it changing?
5. Impact worldcloud. Do some words crop up often in the impact descriptions?

And maybe, with some more development:

6. Is repo alive. We can ping it, but a more comprehensive test would be better.
7. Do licence, citation, etc. type of files exist? (Open Source Health Check maybe?)
8. Search for research domain infomation, put together a list of software used in particular domains, and then publish that list to aid re-use.
